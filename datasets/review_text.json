Since it was up the street from the hotel I am staying, this trip transported me to Japan via a strip mall.  I got in just as it opened and welcomed me ( in japanese) .  Being the first customer there I recognized this is a small place(31 seats). Reservations are a must .  But when you get in, be prepared to be amazed by the food presented at the table ( or bar).  Anything  that you order will astound your taste buds, especially if  you order from the specials menu. Their signature item is the agedashi tofu- tofu made in house with dashi broth, tiny mushrooms, fish eggs and a little hot sauce on rim of the bowl.  This will redefine what tofu should taste like- soft and silky smooth.  The kobe beef skewers were awesome: two skewers, one laced with garlic, the other  in miso.  But the third special item, negi toro, was sublime (toro chopped up fine to a near paste); combined with real wasabi and homemade soy sauce(yes, homemade, not kikkoman). Service was exceptional and very friendly as if you were a long time customer.

Loved it and would come back for that and Kobe beef skewers =) the restaurant feels claustrophobic and I felt it wasn't a great date restaurant but more for a small group of four good friends.

The service was friendly and efficient; the wait staff were happy to explain menu items in detail; what they did not do was tell us the price of the specials on the board as they described them.  We foolishly ordered one of each, only to find when we got the check that they had each been $32!  They also charged me $30 each for my two glasses of house chardonnay.  That part we were able to straighten out, but I wonder about people who don't check their bill carefully.  i wouldn't like to think that they make this kind of error too often.  The food though, was to die for and the friendliness of their farewells to every party made this a wonderful experience over all.

The foie gras was amazing and I wanted to order 5 more of those things. Not that they were small, but it's just that damn good.

Overall it was good, the service prompt and courteous.  We had a great selection off the menu but nothing moved us and we are doubtful to return.  If you want to try a Japanese Grill for the experience, it is worth going.  In our party of three, no one said they would return as nothing was memorable.  One last thing, if you order off the Chef's special menu do not be surprised at the bill as the prices are not listed.

This small, cozy, reservation-only place is off the hook!! (excuse my slang, I just don't know any other ways to put it) I thought Ichiza was the only late night Japanese hang out place in Vegas, but I was wrong! This place serves authentic Japanese food for very reasonable price, just like Ichiza, but in more sophisticated style. I have ordered Foie Gras, Oden, Raku-Tofu, Agedashi-Tofu, Green Tea Creme Brulee, and Brown Sugar Flan. Everything tasted far beyond my expectation. Servers took time to explain how to eat every dish, and my tea cup was never empty for no more than 5 minutes. Great service! You can tell they put no weird chemicals to boost up the flavor, and food was simple, genuine, healthy, and marvelous. As soon as I've heard this place is reservation-only, I put their phone number in my phone... that's how much they've blown off my mind.

We ordered so much food but the most memorable was the Agedashi tofu.  I think it's housemade.  There's a subtle sweetness to the tofu that leaves me wanting more and more.  Dinner for two was around $150.  I recommend making a reservation since the place is small and usually packed.  I prefer the robata grill items over the sushi.   And if you must, check out the bathroom.  If you are a bird fan, well it might just be your thing but me... it was just a tad creepy.  -M2", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

The sake tasting is a great way of accessing the sake menu.  My only quibble is that I'd put a reasonably priced domestic sparkling wine on the list (Roederer Brut, Roederer Brut Rose, Domaine Carneros) because the French ones are off the charts price-wise (delicious choices, but I'm not ordering Dom P), and the domestic choices were not great.

We did request some things to be included in the prefix menu, kobe beef skirt steak, duck, and the crunchy asparagus.  I gotta say this trip was better than last.  We had over 10 dishes each.  The pork cheeks and skirt steak were awesome, though I recommend dipping it in the sauce it comes with for extra flavor.  All in all, every dish that came out was good.

They don't show that they serve sashimi or nigiri, but if you try to ask another server later on they may budge and sell it to you anyways.

I guess if you eat something ahead of time, you should be fine.   All joking aside, this is a great place to enjoy good food.   Do not expect large portions.   Expect to pay a pretty penny.

If you are not on a budget, and want to try great bite-size food items, go to Roku.   P.S.  Make a reservation.   Sometimes they make people wait even if there is an open table.  Not sure if they do this to give an impression or not.  But I saw 2 or 3 groups be asked to come back in 40-50 minutes and then be sitted at the same empty table that was there when they arrived.

Kurobuta pork cheek was the best, tender and not too salty, and crispy. Oden was just ok, I had better one. The butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce was devine (a bit small for $7). We came at 11:30 midnight because they were super small and busy. A lot of items were sold out, so bummed. We wanted to try the juicy fried chicken, steamed foie gras egg custard, kobe beef tongue, oyakodon, green soba, the little hot pot on small fire stove, and crispy fried shrimp. Oh, they had 2 bathrooms, the prettiest I have ever seen! The sea ocean theme with aquarium and nice ocean ceiling, lighting and wall, and nice bedat seat.

We weren't familiar with a lot of the items or authentic Japanese dining, so we had to enlist the staff for help. They were great with suggestions on what and how to order. Raku makes their own tofu, so we started with a 1/2 order of their most popular one. It was delicious. We selected a large variety of meats and vegetables from the grill. Apparently, Raku imports their coals for the grill from Japan. Whatever they're doing, they need to keep doing. Everything was delicious. My favorites were the garlic Kobe steak and bacon wrapped tomatoes. My husband loved the yellowtail tuna. Everything comes out on 2-3 bite skewers and is arranged in order of lightest to heaviest.

Some of it, like the foie gras, was a little rich for my taste, but quality nonetheless. We had two desserts (cheesecake and creme brulee), neither of which was anything to write home (or Yelp) about. Also, the wine pours are either done by someone with poor depth perception or possibly Japan has a different definition of a glass of wine, as they were stingy with the grape juice. With as popular as this place is (reservations are a must), I am not sure why they do not open a larger location, as the current one is cramped and not very inviting. The service was adequte, but not overly nice or accommodating. Focus on the small plates, and keep the rest in the periphery.", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

So I came here this past weekend just for a light late night snack ordering their foie gras, foie gras custard, bacon wrapped tomatoes and of course their Agedashi tofu.  All the dishes were great and as I remembered from the last few times I visited, but the Agedashi tofu was off for once.  It was not silky smooth on the inside as it normally is.

Not a place I'd normally visit on my own so was excited to try some different food. I tried pretty much everything that wasn't fish on the a la cart menu and with the exception of the fried shrimp I was happy or delighted. The fois gras was the highlight - I ordered a second round. Actually the sake was the real highlight and the wait staff was the second best highlight. My companion knows good sake and ordered each of us a glass of his favorite and it knocked my socks off. When he then asked about ordering a small bottle of a different sake the wait staff steered him clear of it, which was a classy move. Things that knocked Raku down from five stars: at the time my companion reconfirmed the reservation which he'd made months in advance he was  warned that they needed to turn over the table by 8pm and we'd need to vacate - definitely not a classy move. Second, their menu was out of date - when I ordered dessert I was told the item had been discontinued for some time. On the plus side, we were steered to Raku's sister dessert restaurant in the same plaza and had a five-star experience there - yes, even better than Raku!", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

All of the dishes were exceptionally fresh and each respective dish tantalized our palates. Their dishes were exceedingly simple, yet complex and robust in taste.

However, we are not contemplating sushi because Raku does not serve any sushi, sashimi yes. And the fish is unique species and entirely fresh and beautifully presented! So, this is really apples to oranges. What Raku does offer is a very perfected version of grilled Japanese cuisine. The homemade tofu and soy are unrivaled, bar none anywhere. So, if you like these things please come here to try the best. Their sake selection is good, too. And the roasted green tea after my meal was exceptional quality. So, why only 4/5 stars? Well, my glassware - both water and sake vessels were smelly. I am serious. This really left a mark on my otherwise near perfect meal.

{"text": "This was the best dinner I have had in YEARS. We were very lucky to get a reservation at the last minute, the hostess was very sweet and accommodating! The space itself is small, tastefully decorated, and feels like a step outside of Vegas entirely- it's quietly luxurious, with intimate tables and dimmed lighting. The minute we sat down, our waiter came over and explained the specials, one of which we decided to order, the Sukiyaki. We started with the Raku Tofu, which you would have to be crazy not to try. It is unlike anything I have ever experienced. The wait staff explain how best to enjoy it (first with some Green Tea salt, then with some ginger, green onion, and bonito flakes with a bit of soy sauce), and it is unbelievably delicious and silky. Even if you don't usually like tofu, I highly recommend trying this! We also tried the agedashi tofu, which was equally delicious and served in a perfectly seasoned broth with nori flakes and salmon roe, and a little spot of chili sauce on the side of the bowl to be used sparingly. Next we tried the kobe beef with garlic, which was another huge hit- incredibly flavorful, tender, just perfect. I am no steak expert, but my boyfriend is, and he was just as blown away as I was. We had the crispy deep fried chicken, which was served on top of a bed of spinach dressed with what I think was a soy vinaigrette- amazing. Then came the duck in a balsamic soy glaze, which is another MUST-order here- again, completely unlike anything I've ever tasted. We shared one stuffed small portobello, which was outstanding, and then came the sukiyaki. If they have this special when you visit, I cannot recommend it highly enough. It comes with eggs, which you crack into your own bowl and then use as a dipping sauce- I didn't do that part, but the sukiyaki itself was just unreal. The broth was perfect, not too salty but by no means bland, and there were noodles, tofu, greens, japanese eggplant, and the most amazing, thin sliced beef either of us had ever tasted. We made the mistake of ordering one too many things, and by the time the grilled rice balls (aka onigiri but without the nori) arrived, we were both right on the verge of being too full. If you are a fan of really high quality rice, you will love these- one is brown rice and flavored with bonito flakes, and one is white rice with a shinto leaf wrapped around it. Both are of course fantastic, but for us they weren't the stars of the evening the way the tofu and beef had been. And of course it wasn't over, we ordered the fluffy cheesecake- both of us gasped when we tried it. It is like eating a cheesecake cloud. It is the lightest, fluffiest cheesecake that exists on earth, I am sure of it. Even if you decide to follow up your meal with a trip to Sweets Raku (it was closed when we went, otherwise we probably would have gone- next time for sure!), this is another must. On top of the beyond amazing food, they have a fantastic wine and sake list, and the service was truly exceptional. Warm, attentive, prompt, helpful- it felt like we were being spoiled! I seriously can't recommend Raku highly enough. We will be coming back ALL THE TIME!", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

When we inquired about the disparity, we were told that the Omakase was based on the size of the table. However everything we saw the neighboring table receive, was on the regular a la carte menu so the refusal to serve us the Wagyu with egg and the fatty tuna dishes (especially after the server confirmed we had both ordered the high end Omakase) was surprising and perhaps, insulting given that we had been served a basic (ie bland) skewered filet from the Robata portion of the menu.

When we pulled into the parking lot there was only one car there and we were not sure they were open, even though the sign said they were. We tried the door and were greeted my David( the owner) with a warm hello. He welcomed us and told us about how he came here from Naples Florida and just opened a month ago. He assured us we would love our meal and he was right. He made a couple of suggestion and we settled on starting with the Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli. We watched Lisa, David's wife and a wonderful chef, prepare the appetizer from our table. It is nice to see an open kitchen where you can watch everything being freshly made. For dinner I had the Red Nah noodles and my wife had the Massaman Curry. Both were outstanding, although I have to take my wife's word on the curry since I don't enjoy curry. The portions were good size and we even had a little left to take home. My only trepidation about writing this review is that Pan Asian is a small restaurant with only about 14 seats and I don't want to always have to wait in line for my new favorite local place.

We ordered the spicy chicken salad, DW fried rice, massaman curry (outstanding!) and the shrimp ravoli type item (this was our least favorite but not bad).  I would highly recommend venturing off the strip to have a great meal at Pan Asian.", "business_id": "8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg"}

There's even avacado in the dish.   What a wonderful surprise!  Crying Tiger (beef salad) is also great.  The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was their TomYum soup.", "business_id": "8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg"}

My friend also got the Thai linguine which was good but nothing to be too excited about. My favorite was the Pa cha with thilapia that's a must have. Unfortunately the duck was off the menu that day so might be back to try that another day. I have to say price vise i have had cheaper Thai food at few other places just as good as this, but this is one of the better place.

{"text": "My boyfriend discovered this place near his office so I decided to check out the reviews on Yelp. I scored a yelp deal and got some $20 gift certificates for $10 each. The first time we went we ordered the Grilled Squid Salad, Malaysian Yellow Curry and Red Nah Noodles. All were good but the squid in the grilled squid salad was amazing! The second time we visited we order the Seafood Soup and the Crying Tiger Salad. The owner also suggested we try the Vietnamese Style Chicken Wings (which was not on the menu). Once again, the squid in the soup was excellent--very tender. Overall, I'd recommend this place to my friends if they want an alternative to Archi's, Pin Kaow or the like but within the same price range. I'd also recommend finding the Yelp deal that I did: $10 for $20 worth of food. Also, I'd like to mention that the Owners are very friendly and remembered us from a month ago when we first visited.", "business_id": "8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg"}

{"text": "Eating here was a good experience.  I bought the Yelp Deal: $20 for $10.  I've decided that Groupon mostly sends you to places that are having troubles for a reason.  That is, I'm usually disappointed with the Groupon experiences.  Yelp Deals, on the other hand, have turned out pretty good so far.  This place is a little far from home.  Usually, if I drive this far then I just go on down to Chinatown.  Parking was ok.  Upon entering I turned to my girlfriend and commented about how this was probably going to be a bad experience because the place was totally empty.  It was around 6:45 pm on Tuesday.  But, we settled in determined to give it a fair try.  I began noticing all of the nice things about the place.  It was nicely decorated.  I assume the owner did the decorating.  I describe it as contemporary Asian.  It was not high end Vegas strip decorating style, but more like well put together do it yourself style.  The kitchen was in full view of the dining area.  I always like that.  I cringe to think what goes on out of sight.  So many restaurant shows today let us normal people peek behind the curtain and witness the often disgusting truth.  Also, I was delighted to see Asian people making Asian food.  At least makes me believe I'm in for authentic flavors.  Modern music played lightly over the audio system.  It was pleasant.  I assume the man waiting on us was the owner, David Wong.  He was very friendly and attentive.  He did a really good job.  He tried very hard to give us a great experience.  Every item on the menu was under $11.  That's pretty good.  I like good food, but I enjoy it even better when I feel like I'm getting a good deal.  The menu had a variety of Asian dishes, as the name implies: Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese, etc.  We ordered two dishes.  The first was Filet Mignon Pho.  It was a Thai version of Vietnamese Pho.  My Thai girlfriend explained that the abundance of roasted garlic was a signature difference.  The sauces were all added before serving.  The veggies were slightly different (can't explain) and the meat was filet mignon (Wow! Step It Up!).  The noodles were cooked just right.  I enjoyed the Pho, but there are way better places to get Pho in this town.  The second dish was Basil Sauace Stir Fry.  It had chicken, sweet basil, garlic, chili tomatoes, and long beans served with rice.  Spiciness was 8 out of 10.  It was really tasty.  I specifically enjoyed the fresh veggies.  My only complaint was that the dish had too much oil.  I realized just how much after we finished the dish and were left staring at the puddle before us.  It made me feel a little bad about something I had just enjoyed.  We were pretty much full, but wanted to spend at least $20 for the Yelp deal so we ordered another entree.  We had asked the server earlier what their signature dish was.  He recommended the Pad-See-Yaw.  So, that's what we ordered.  It was pan-fried flat noodles with pork, broccoli, black soy beans, and egg.  My girlfriend explained that this dish is commonly ordered by Caucasians at Thai restaurants.  She was surprised that I had never heard of it (we usually eat Thai food at her house, not restaurants).  It was very sweet.  My girlfriend and the server had a quick conversation in Thai.  He asked if we wanted a dessert.  We said no, but I thought the sweet Pad-See-Yaw was dessert.  After he left, my girlfriend explained that she told him it was too sweet and he replied that its how Americans like it.  I thought that was funny.  We were already full when the third dish came out so we tasted it and put it in a to go box.  The server came by and chatted with us for a while.  He explained that he had been open for about nine months.  Before that he had a successful high end Asian restaurant in Florida.  Articles hung on the wall behind us explaining it.  By the time we left it had become pretty busy.  The place had four or five more couples and a few take out customers came through.  Overall, it was a good experience.  The server was attentive and the food came out fast.  The menu was very affordable.  The decorations were interesting and inviting.  I really wanted to give it five starts, but  the food was good, not great.  Its worth a try.", "business_id": "8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg"}
{"text": "The beauty of Yelp is that you can discover great places that you drive right by all the time, hiding in plain sight.  This is the case with Pan Asian.  It's been one of my bookmarked places for quite a while and I finally got to experience it for myself last night.  Arriving there around 7:30pm and armed with the Yelp deal, my boyfriend and I were the third party seated in the restaurant.  As other reviews have already stated, Pan Asian is run by a husband and wife team and that's it!  He's the host and waiter and she's the chef.  I already knew that we had to try the tiger mango shrimp salad and the Thai Linguine because I trust most Yelpers and those dishes were highly recommended.  Let me tell you, I felt like we hit the jackpot again!  If I could have that salad every day, I would!  It had real greens, not the wanna-be iceberg lettuce.  The mango and grilled shrimp combined to make it one of the best salads I've had, light and savory.  We ordered the Thai Linguine with shrimp and not spicy AT ALL, because I'm wimpy that way.  This dish, too, was great.  I'm usually boring and order Pad Thai when I have Thai food, but not when I return here, and, yes, I will definitely be back!  It's the kind of place that you want to return to again and again to see how everything else on the menu tastes.

{"text": "After last night's fiasco at Lily's Thai-Vietnamese-Chinese restaurant, I had to think twice about trying another Thai-Vietnamese-Japanese fusion place so soon, BUT the $10 for $20 Yelp offer and the 4.5star rating after hundreds of reviews, I decided to give David Wong's Pan Asian a chance and I AM SO GLAD I DID! The food was SO DELICIOUS that we actually went back there the next night bringing the rest of the crew JUST so they can try the CRYING TIGER SALAD! Me & my family have now found a new fave place to eat! We ordered various items on the menu, and they were all good, food was freshly made and NO MSG! I am just going to give you a run down of MAI FAVES though, so here goes, definitely try the Roti, it comes with a  lightly sweet Malaysian yellow curry dipping sauce, the curries were really good too, we tried the massaman, & the panang, & the Pad See Ew was so flavorful , we tried the shrimp tiger salad with mangoes, that was delicious as well, but I have to say that the STAR of the dinner table was the Crying Tiger Salad, the steak was cooked just right, it melted in your mouth, you can tell it's char broiled, the dressing was phenomenal! I have to warn you though,they don't call it Crying Tiger for nothing, be careful when ordering your spice # coz the spiciness will make a tiger cry! I had # 3 and it was SPICY but good! My crazy husband dared to get # 4! Most of their menu items are spicy, so if you are not into spicy food your choices will be limited, but the owners and chef are VERY accommodating and will try to cater to your specific needs. Oh, and yes dessert, we definitely had room for dessert. We tried the fried ice cream as well as the fried cheesecake, I definitely like the fried cheese cake better, although we did clean both plates, Hungry much? We are definitely coming back to this place, it is pretty small, but I like to call it cozy, oh & YES they speak very fluent English! You can see the chef, who is David Wong's wife, lovingly preparing the meal you are about to chow down. You can clearly tell that she puts her heart & soul into her cooking, even though this is a small mom & pop restaurant all the dishes are presented like a work of art. They take pride in their product that is why they give it their best.

{"text": "I have a friend who like to eat good food as much as I do.  So when he recommended Pan Asian to me I agreed to give it a try.  It is a 25 minute drive from where I live to the restaurant, I have to drive through Chinatown to get there.  Its worth the drive.   David and Lisa are husband and wife and the owners of the place.  The kitchen is open so you can see exactly what is going on.  It is very clean.  They will make you feel like family.  David makes it a point to know everyone by name and the next time you come in he will ask about the people that were there last time.  The food is top notch I have eaten at several Thai restaurants including one in town that is a favorite on the food network channel, there is nothing that is close to the quality of food that Chef Lisa prepares.  She will vary the heat according to your taste.  I like an 8 on most things, in the soup it is a slow heat that builds.  She uses fresh Thai peppers and they do not release their heat immediately, so be careful.  I normally order one of the soups to start an entree and then dessert.  The Fishball and Beef Noodle Soups are both excellent.  They are always asking us to try something new, that isn't on the menu.  The Red and Duck Curries are incredible.  Each of the ingredients maintains its individual flavor and yet they all work together.  Sometimes they have a Key Lime Pie in a small cup it is yummy.  Maybe if I mention it enough people will ask for it and they will have it all of the time.  It is the perfect compliment to the spicy food.  The Sticky Rice with Mango and sesame seeds is very nice.  There is a little bit of sea salt that accents the warm sticky rice and the ice cold mango with coconut milk. If I find something that I don't like I will let you know but so far everything that I have tried I would eat again.  it is getting tougher to get through the menu as I go back to what I have eaten before.", "business_id": "8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg"}

The chicken satay was also very good, meat was moist and had the best peanut sauce I've tasted so far. Most peanut sauce  I have tasted is usually overpowering with flavor, this sauce was just well blended and flavorful. The Crying Tiger salad was different in a good way, spicy and the dressing had just the right amount of sourness. The Duck curry of course was  our favorite. The meat perfectly moist inside and just crisped right outside. The curry was just a perfect balance with the duck and brought out the flavor from the meat, plus I never thought the grapes in the dish would work but it did. Lastly the fried ice cream was the perfect ending to a wonderful dinner. Lisa the cook is absolutely amazing. Doreen our server was very friendly and informative about our menu selections.

Flat noodles, tossed with a perfect blend of seasoning, tomatoes and green beans. My husband must try the sweet and sour chicken at every new place we try.

These were probably the best drunken noodles I've had out of countless places that I have already tried. The price was around $11 and we also shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious at the time, but pretty forgettable. I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average).

There is a delicious way to calm the volcano and that is fried ice-cream another way to justify the calories to cool the burn. I love this place and will be back many many more times.

It tastes like a spicy seafood egg custard. Pad see-yew  which is a pan fried noodles with Chinese broccoli, black soy beans and  egg is just okay.  Pork red curry with pumpkin eggplant bell peppers coconut milk is too sweet for my taste. I want my curry spicier. They have daily specials and I chose the Pan seared salmon with mango sauce, greens, cashews--- it's very refreshing but a bit salty from the fish sauce. They have better thai iced tea compared to other places. Fast efficient service. The owner himself went to our table and explained their menu which I think is a nice touch. Will definitely come back.

The Chicken Satay was so moist and perfect! The Mango Salad is the best here, they are not stingy. The Filet Mignon Noodle Soup was really good because the meat was very soft. The Pad Thai was not my favorite though, I was actually disappointed, it's not bad, but it didn't stand out to me. Lastly we had Fried Banana w/ Ice Cream, and I didn't like it because there was coconut flakes in it and they use plantains and so it wasn't very tasty, I like it sweeter.

Lets just say we all went home full and there wasn't much left. Everyone at the table enjoyed General Tso's the most. Also there was a cold spicy noodle appetizer that was very unique and amazing.

I ordered the sliced pork and mushroom noodles and it was to die for! Not your AMERICANIZED CHINESE FOOD!!! The noodles were very tasty, soft and just the perfect consistency. The combination of flavors with the 3 kinds of mushrooms and sliced pork along with the sauce, was amazing!

We've been longing for a high quality sushi restaurant, ever since experiencing Sushi Sasabune, twice I might add, in Honolulu.

{"text": "First time we came here it was phenomenal. Second time, not so much. Of note, our favorite item both times being the negitoro hand roll. This time we ordered one omakase ($80) and one nigiri tasting ($48). The main differences between the omakase and nigiri tasting are 6 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of grilled fish, and miso soup. Was it worth the extra $32? Certainly not. The main problem during this visit was that the serving sizes were significantly smaller than last time, ranging from 1/3 to 1/2 smaller. The first time we had 2 nigiri tastings because that was all they were offering at the time. While we weren't stuffed, our hunger was comfortably satiated. This time around we paid for more food, but both left hungry. In fact, as we left, I seriously considered stopping by Ramen Sora! The quality overall is still excellent, except for the surprisingly subpar miso soup, but they have gotten stingy with their portion sizes. Previously, while not an inexpensive night out, the price could be considered reasonable. Sadly this is no longer the case. We are not big eaters and when we pay $128, before tax/tip, for two tasting menus, we expect to at least not be still hungry at the end. We don't mind shelling out top dollar for great food, but it is difficult to justify paying these prices for what have become miniscule portions of food. In addition, the service this time was inconsistent at best. The timing between courses was highly variable as was when our glasses of water were refilled. It is heartbreaking, and we are unlikely to return.", "business_id": "AYbUb5UcAngroJ6uJG7tLQ"}

Don't get me wrong the fish quality was very high but not much better than other higher end sushi restaurants that were cheaper.  Your paying for ambiance and intimacy but I found it hard to justify the prices for sushi. There was nothing all that special or unique about their fish when you compare it to other higher end restaurants. The most unique thing I noticed was how small all their portions of fish were.  I am not advocating disgustingly large portions as is typical with many American restaurants but this was a bit ridiculous to me. We spent around 200 per person ordering both omakase and a la carte.

They'll give you a sweet icy saki shot at first and a quick appetizer. As soon as your mouth starts watering they'll serve the main course of sushi one by one, each one progressively getting better and better.

The food was very very good and the presentation stellar.  Loved the custom-made wooden chef counter and the well-thought out interior.  The only thing that could have been better was a slower pace between the dishes.

The service was great and the staff was friendly and attentive.  The starter was a peach sake that the owner made himself.  The raw fish dishes were amazing and fresh!

We got a bunch of tuna such as medium fatty toro, ikura and toro hand roll.  At first I felt the meal was going by too quickly but it ended up being an hour and half.  Along with the sushi, you get sake and you get ice cream.  Sake was very good as was the ice cream.  I've never had roasted green tea ice cream.  It was such a great flavor.

They said that they cannot guarantee reservations at the sushi bar. Huh? What is the point of making a reservation if they will not honor the reservation? We always drop $300+ when we dine at Kabuto's, and for that kind of money we expect our reservations to be honored as long as we are punctual.

Each dish that comes out is absolutely superb and in perfect ordering to complement the taste of the last piece you ate. They will explain to you what order to eat it in. The kumamoto oyster was the most delicate and spectacular piece of food you can ever eat. The quality of the fatty toro was the best I've had. The layer crepe for dessert at the end was a beautiful ending to the story. 5 girls who usually would talk the entire time ate in complete silence, savoring every bite.

Having recently visited Tokyo, I can appreciate the preparation and pride this restaurant takes in their food. The sushi and sashimi here can stand up to many of the fine establishments in Tokyo and the price at Kabuto is very reasonable for the quality you receive. They are passionate about the way their food is presented and inspect each piece of fish carefully before serving. Any sushi pro knows that not only is the fish an important aspect of sushi but the rice is equally if not more important. The rice was prepared very well (warm with a slight hint of vinegar). The taste of the rice complemented the fish so well it makes my mouth water thinking of it now. The service was friendly and the servers were helpful in educating the patrons on where each food item came from. In case you didn't already know, they receive their products fresh daily from all over the world. One place that they receive their fish from is the famous Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. The fish here meets the standards of fish sold right at that market. The chefs prepare each plate as a piece of art and the timing of each food item is perfect. If you are a foodie and like traditional Japanese sushi then you must check this place out. No cream cheese and spicy mayo rolls here! In my opinion there is no other sushi restaurant in Vegas that is close to Kabuto. That includes the big names on the strip.", "business_id": "AYbUb5UcAngroJ6uJG7tLQ"}

{"text": "Took my girl here for something different as i have been here before and it was great.  Not this time. Service was fine-poor i had to wait over 35 minutes for a fat choy burger while my girl gets her short ribs and rice within 20 is not acceptable.  My girl said the amount of short ribs was about half of what she has had there before and rice was under cooked. My burger was ok  not as juicy as in the past. Server told us that my dish was comimg right up but it was another 15 minutes. There was only  2 tables of two when we arrived and one was already eating.  Poor management by not having more staff.  Only go back if i have some time to kill.  Still waiting for manager to come over.", "business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ"}
{"text": "Despite what others have said, my wife and I found Fat Choy and the Eureka Casino to be a fairly nice little place.  It's very clean and the food at Fat Choy is to die for.  The casino is just eat of the strip on Sahara, I wouldn't call it the ghetto, but it's not a well travelled place for tourists.  The casino is a little smoky and appeared to be frequented by mostly Asian locals.  Excellent lunch.  We had the Duck Bao, Pork Belly Bao, and the Tofu and Mushroom Bao.  All fantastic, but the favorite was the pork belly.  We also tried an order of Grandma's Pot stickers.  They were good, but we'll stick to the bao and other offerings. Definitely will go back.", "business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ"}

Food came out fast and it looks pretty good I'm gonna demolish this! Ok the pork belly is really good. The bao is warm and soft and the pork belly is crispy and the flavor is yummy. I ate it so fast I forgot to chew. This peanut lodged in the back of my throat is totally worth it! :) pot stickers are done well. Overall I'm really happy I picked this place for lunch.", "business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ"}

{"text": "This restaurant now offers a Sunday only brunch menu.  There were no other diners during our entire visit so finding a table did not present a major problem.  My wife ordered a traditional eggs Benedict while I sought gold by choosing the Fat Benedict.  The latter is served with pork belly rather than the traditional Canadian bacon. Each was as close to perfection as possible - toasted English muffins, easy over eggs and a delicious Hollandaise sauce.  Both came with freshly prepared home fries.  Our server was very friendly and took care of all our needs.  Prior to departing we had the opportunity to talk to and compliment the chef.", "business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ"}

{"text": "Fat Choy is such a neat little oddity in the Eureka Casino. I ate there with two friends and we shared everything. The only miss were the dumplings. Anything with duck in it was grand. The Fat Choy Burger was delightful. As far as adult beverages, FC only serves beer, but there is a full bar right outside the restaurant, and our server had no problem with us bringing in beverages from there. Which makes you think it would be quite easy to be a little sneaky and BYOB. Overall, FC is great, cheap option in a head-scratching location.", "business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ"}

{"text": "Start this journey with a short walk through the smoke filled older style casino. Lucky it was only a short walk cuz the stale cigarette smell was a bit overwhelming. I had the pork belly and duck bao. You get 2 with each order for  $7 an order, I thought it was a bit much for such small bites. Flavors were good on both and I would say the pork belly was a little better. The duck was crispy but all the flavor was in the sauce not from the duck meat. The rest of the menu doesn't have many options but there was a special board I noticed on the way out, it wasn't pointed out when I was handed the menu. The server was very nice and efficient so definitely a plus for service.", "business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ"}
{"text": "Yes, the Eureka Casino is a dump, but who cares?? Even the nicest casino is still just a money- sucking corporate monster. This little spot is a gem. It was my birthday and I wanted badly to get over here to try the bao and the short rib grilled cheese so my girl and I left our suite in the Cosmo and headed out to the hood.. Service was a little slow but so worth it. The pork belly bao is one of the finest morsels of delectability I've ever tasted. Soft, sweet, smoky and tangy...it alone is worth a visit. Pot stickers were money, shortrib grill cheese an absolute smash hit also, 2+ kinds of cheese with super tender braised short ribs shredded on top of the cheeses. Damn, I want another one now. Our server Val was super friendly and attentive. Easy access to cheap cheap booze at the bar about 10 steps outside the restaraunt. $3.50 for a jack and coke. I used to live in this part of town and if Fat Choy had been in here then, I might have never left. Actually that's not true....the apartments behind the Hilton are only for the very broke and brave.", "business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ"}

If I remember correctly the tofu & mushrooms were cut up but this time they put a slab of tofu which I prefer it cut up & mixed in with the mushrooms. The duck bao didn't taste as flavorful.

Mixing the duck meat with the egg and rice created a creamy, just-enough fatty dish that was hard to resist.  The duck bao was incredibly, finished with hoisen sauce and a sliver of cucumber.
