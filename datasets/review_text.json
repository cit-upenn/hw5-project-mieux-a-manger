Our favorite Indian is Ajanta in Berkeley and the Red Fort in London - but the Samosa Factory can give either a run for their money.  We're looking forward to our next trip to Las Vegas so we can go back twice or three times during our stay - our only regret is that we found it on our last night in town."}

I will be coming back more often now specially for lunch since their prices are as good as any joints around town.

Neither of us was particularly hungry and after getting drinks decided to ask the server for his advice. We decided on ordering a few different samosas. We had chicken, vegetable, and lamb. We also got an order or spiced fries. It was the perfect for the two of us. Everything was delicious and we were checked upon often.

Food Express kills most places in China town when it comes to the quality and taste of their food. Every item we ordered was so fresh and full of flavor.

He's a really upbeat guy who greets you when you walk in the door and is really helpful with deciding what to have.  He asked me if I was hungry and he immediately told me to get the combo when I said yes.  Boy was he right, it was delicious, and the perfect amount of food, and for $9.50 I feel it was a great deal.

This is a new flavor and texture for me AND it was fantastic!!  Thinly sliced ribeye covered in egg that was fluffy that you dip into a teriyaki sauce.

While Island Style's menu certainly  holds its own against its competition, its true advantage lies in its affable, long-time owner, Russell.  His enthusiasm for his offerings is as unprecedented as it is well-deserved.  My family and I have enjoyed nearly every item on his menu, and we have yet to be disappointed.  During our most recent visit, Russell even went so far as to invite us to call him if we ever would like to try to cook one of his specialties at our home in Houston.  Not a chance!  We shall continue to let the master do his work in the kitchen while we sip hot tea and eat boiled peanuts in his dining room.  Do not be fooled by the storefront and off-strip location.

Located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, this place has about 16 quad tables.  There are 8 of them side by side in the middle of the room so you can put several parties of 8 easily, so it's group friendly.  The menu is mainly Korean, but for some reason, they choose to put the word Island in the name of the restaurant giving me the impression they were Hawaiian.  We had the BBQ combo and the Pork Katsu.  I was looking for the Hawaiian aspect, but ended up with a Korean aberation of Hawaiian food.  The katsu sauce was more like a ketchup sauce or a shrimp cocktail sauce.  The pork katsu was over cooked and dry.  I suspect the cutlet was under a heat lamp i.e. precooked like a mickey dees.   The Kalbi and BBQ chicken were good.  The meat jun is coated with egg and like the cutlet, I seemed like it was a heat lamp item too.  It didn't have that freshly made taste.  I was disappointed after reading the good reviews.  If I come back, it would be for the Korean food because the photos on the wall look really good.  Maybe they should change the name of the restaurant to Seoul Style to give the customers a better description of what you're going to get."}

Ordered the loco moco and got a nice sized hamburger patty on top of a huge mound of rice and topped with an egg and lots of gravy, Also had to try a side of Spam, which was grilled to perfection but a little too salty for me. The loco moco was just like the ones I had in Hawaii, though. The kimchi was great, especially the one that has been fermenting for a while, although it has a huge bite, so watch out when you are eating it. The regular kimchi was very good as were the pickled radishes. The staff makes you feel like you are in the islands with their laid back attitude and attentive service.

Everything on the menu looked good, I wanted to order everything! Drinks were only $1! I definitely will come back to this place just so I can try out their other dishes.

For those that don't know, meat jun, is Korean BBQ marinated meat that's dipped in egg batter and then cooked.  It might sound weird but it's so good.  We also tried the BBQ chicken and the short ribs and both were great.  Service was super friendly.  Get that aloha vibe.  Made me miss Hawaii so much.  They served the typical Korean side dishes but they also served sliced up sauteed hot dog and onion and I've never seen that before but it just hit the spot.  So simple and so good.

Not a huge place, 12 tables with 1 flat screen tv for viewing. I was pleasantly surprised to find they have rice cake soup(w/ or w/o mandoo) and chinese black bean noodles(jya jya myun) available here among other things. I was considering some chicken katsu, meat jun or fried rice til that caught my eye. I settled on black bean noodles. Side dishes included boiled peanuts, bean sprouts, kimchi, fish cake and pan fried hot dog & onions. All were good but the kimchi was a tad bland, probably due to it not being pickled that long. Service was good and my tab was $7+tax, pretty hard to beat for that much food. Rating may change with more visits but I will have to come back and try a few of the other hawaiian local food. I wanted to give this rating 4.5 stars but theres no half star option. From my first visit tho it seems like a good spot if you like hawaiian local style and korean foods."}

They were super friendly taking my money but when there is an issue they certainly don't care.  I ate here twice. Both times the black bean noodles were way too greasy (was trying to give it another try).  The champon seafood noodle soup was ok but just because you throw in a bunch of seafood it doesn't impress me if it isn't quality.  The kimchi fried rice was ridiculously salty so I just took it home and mixed white rice with it.  I think the great reviews exist due to personal taste, and Hawaiian style food is usually cultural not something most people like.  It's not like Italian or sushi where quality is a must, because from reading some reviews about this Island restaurant, quality is not a standard...cockroaches and dirty diapers? Definitely not appetizing."}

Cha jhang myun ( noodles in black bean sauce) , champ pong ( noodles in spicy seafood broth) and tang soo yook ( Korean version of sweet and sour pork or beef. I grew up in New York and later Northern NJ where these restaurants were plentiful. There are none of these restaurants here in Las Vegas so I'm very excited. I've only tried the tang soo yook (pork) and cha Jang sauce and fried rice so far ( all delicious so far). But I plan to work my way through the entire menu soon!"}

The banchan was fresh, spicy and a wonderful prelude to the entrees. The mixed grill plate was the epitome of what grilled meat should be; juicy yet crispy and full of flavor.

They served you boiled peanuts while you wait, which is super tasty. The panchan (side dishes) changes day by day. My favorites are the bean sprouts and the Kim chee. They add a refreshing kick in between your bites of hot food. I ordered bi bim bop in the stone pot. The meat, rice and vegetables stayed super hot throughout my whole meal and I had to wait a good 5 minutes for me to even take a bite. The rice at the bottom of the pot gets crispy and adds texture to the meal. My bf had the combo plate which came with kalbi, meat jun and teriyaki chicken. All the meat was tender and full of flavor.

I'm a good judge because I've been to Thailand countless times.  The food in Komol is how it'll taste if you are in and ordering in a restaurant in Thailand.  If you are just starting to eat Thai food and wants recommendation, try their Spring Rolls for appetizer.  Go easy on one of the dipping sauces they serve with the spring roll because one of them, the Chinese mustard, shoots up your nose if you use to much and will clear your nasal passages dramatically.  Beef Penang Curry and Combination Fried Rice are my all-time favorite for my main dinner course.  They have a big menu for non-vegetarian and vegetarians.  Explicitly written on their menu that they use MSG in their dishes and that you have to tell them if you want otherwise.  Compared to many restaurants, Komol is a hole in the wall.  But don't be discouraged of their location because you'll find out, esp. if you like good Thai food, that this is a restaurant worth coming back.  Besides being located in a hole in the wall, the ratio of servers to tables is the only other thing I can complain about. I recommend Komol to anybody looking to find out what authentic Thai food is and to those who are just tired of their old favorite Thai restaurant."}

The service is pretty good as the people are friendly and frequently check up on your drinks to refill them. My fav. here is the Pineapple Fried Rice and the Tofu Satay.  I love the spicy-ness of the Fried Rice and if you love spicy, say '10' to let them know how hot you want it... it's spicy but not too over the top. The peanut sauce for the satay is killer and I make sure to always get that when I come in.  Plus, the food is cheap and this place, although it SHOULD be crowded, is more of a quaint, tranquil atmosphere on most occasions; a characteristic I definitely enjoy.  I've also had the combination vegetable appetizer on many occasions and I enjoy that as well."}

For desert the Mango Sticky rice is perfect. I have taken my friends there so often now, that we've become regulars and all of them loved it too.

Spice and such are great on all dishes. I tend to eat things on the 10/10 spice scale, but they'll cook it to whatever level you want. Besides, the tray of crushed peppers is always available on request. The other good thing is they never seem to be too busy - it's neighbor, Lotus of Siam, gets all the fame and crowds - but Komol serves food with as much complexity and flavour for less bucks. Sure, the environment is all bland 1970's booth furniture....(unless they updated it recently)...but you get good food. All the standard dishes are prepared well - green papaya salad, tod mun, pad thai, green/red curry, etc - but they tend to be a bit greasy. Since defecting to Lotus of Siam, I have to give this (barely) one star less in my book, but great Thai food nonetheless!"}

He asked how hot i wanted my curry  and i told him not to hot so he said medium. When i got the curry the flavor was so good but unbearablely HOT! I really couldnt believe this was a medium, i have ordered HOT before from Thai restaurants and it wasent even half the spicyness of this. It was really hard to eat the whole dish because of the hotness. i highly suggest you get mild when ordereing if not it will take away the flavor from the dish"}

You can get anything on the menu veganized- and they have two or three pages on their menu completely dedicated to vegetarian/vegan options.  The food was so fresh and authentic.  Komol just beat out all my other favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas. (Like Archies) I can't wait to go back- try their vegetarian panang, it's phenomonal- all of their curries were great actually.  The spring rolls with soy chicken were fabulous and the carrot/daikon sauce that went with it was to die for.  The sticky rice, mango sorbet, and coconut ice cream scored a 10+ as well.  You have no idea how excited I get when I find a restaurant like this with such fresh, high quality food with so many options for Vegans. There sure aren't very many in Vegas.

I usually get panang or red curry, but I've heard good things about the sesame beef, Indian curry, and sweet and sour chicken.

One of the least recognized items on the menu is the house special omelet. The name and menu description does the dish NO justice. It is to DIE for. The curries are all great, however, if you like a thicker curry, you will have to let them know as the standard at Komol is the runnier version, with exception of the panang curry.

Oh, just be careful with their spicy meter, let them know what you are aiming for and have them suggest a number. :)"}

There was nothing really off with my red curry with chicken but I had ordered medium heat and what I got was about a 2 compared to the Thai places I frequent in Phoenix.  The second visit I started to order the chef special curry and the waiter inquired as to my normal favorite Thai dishes and suggested I should really try the Panang curry which I had never had.  So I did.  And this time medium heat was 4.5 which is certainly close enough to 5.  Just different chefs in the same kitchen will quite often vary more than a full point.

I am the biggest panang consumer in all of Las Vegas, and I immediately noticed the panang recipe here is much different than most other Thai restaurants. Not my favorite here.

We ordered medium spicy, 5, it was more like a 7-8, pretty spicy and we can eat hot.  The herbal salad was just ok to us, not a 5-star dish. The service was friendly but oh so slow, took almost 35 min. before we were served after placing our order.  Probably won't go here again, I like the Thai BBQ joint on 3rd street better.

The Panang curry that every reviewer is raving about did not taste authentic, if anything, they put BBQ sauce in it and made it taste weird. Believe me, I eat a lot of Thai food.

Recommend: chicken panang curry, garlic rice (yum), tom ka soup, beef massaman curry, with the mango sticky rice for dessert. The chicken panang curry and tom ka soup was my favorite. So rich in flavor and the chicken so tender. Delicious! Every item we ordered was good. So if you're looking for some good eats off the strip come here. Why wait an hour at the popular lotus siam next door when you can come here? Great food for reasonable prices and excellent service. They even called a cab for us to get back to our hotel. Highly recommend this little gem. We'll be back."}

Then a waitress came by and told us they were out of Indian curry and asked what else we wanted. 45 minutes in and they are just now telling us that they haven't even started our lunch!!!!

Its menu has a lot of attitude and wonderfully designates all the dishes which can be made vegan--I really appreciated this.

{"business_id": "gkWEjZIVcrUerEzed6IKpg", "text": "I went here a few days ago because it's like 2 miles away from my house. This place has been a few different restaurants in the few years I've lived on this side of town. It was a Himalayan restaurant, and now it's Indian restaurant. The decor inside is very basic. Moss green walls, some black iron pieces on the walls but was largely devoid of cultural ambiance that I particularly like in ethnic restaurants. I feel like decor really adds to an experience, it makes it feel authentic. This place didn't really have that. It was new, so maybe that's why it was so sparsely decorated. I took someone here because they never tried Indian before, so we just ordered the Indian Sampler. The Indian Sampler had about pint sized versions of coconut curry vegetables, lamb vindaloo, chicken masala, lentils, tandoori chicken, yoghurt, kheer, and one other that I can't remember. It was accompanied by 2 pieces of sliced garlic naan and basmati rice. The coconut curry veggies were fantastic, the flavors were excellent. The lamb vindaloo was good, not great. Not as spicy as i'm used to, but not bad. The tandoori chicken was kind of a joke,  it looked like two cornish game hen legs. So micro chicken legs, I thought that looked horrible.  We ordered lychee lassi and mango lassi, and for whatever reason I was served lukewarm mango lassi. I've never received lassi that wasn't cold, so it was a little different for me since the lychee lassi was served over ice. The service was good, no complaints on that. The owner chatted with us a little and was friendly. All in all, it was okay. It wasn't great, the price points are lower than Origin India, so i'd go back if I wanted to pay something a little more moderate. The experience was fun, nothing mind blowing. Origin India just blows it out of the water as far as the quality of the food and ambiance though, so i'd much rather go there if I had a choice."}

Also, the Nepali dishes I had were not very good and I know this because I've lived in Nepal.  The momos tasted like they were made with ready made wonton wrappers from the grocery store.  The momo dough isn't quite the same as a wonton wrapper.  The kwati soup did not appear to be made from NINE types of beans/lentils.  It also did not look like the beans/lentils had been sprouted.

Everything was very good - very different mix of spices than I'm used to at other Indian restaurants, and obviously freshly prepared.  The only negative was that one person in my party ordered channa masala mild, and it came out quite spicy (and she wimped out and didn't send it back)."}

Although it was a buffet, the food was fresh and tasty. They offered good selection of vegetarian and meet items.  In general the atmosphere in that place is good. I will go back.

The price is $9.99 and they usually have a good variety of indian dishes.  If they have Tikka Masala, it is usually watered down... but everthing else is good, especially the Chicken Pakora.   I like the salad area, where they have some nice chutneys.   The nan is good, but they don't always ask if you want more.....and sometimes they get busy and don't refill your water... and if you have a burn going..... that could be dangerous.  Of all the indian restaurants near the strip, this is probably the best.  This place can get full very fast, because it is small.   Parking is not so good, as it is in a busy little strip of stores.  They open at 11:30.   Enjoy!"}

Mint doesnt have as many vegetarian options as Taj Palace who offers about 6 options including a salad bar. I was disappointed that Mint didnt offer any lentil dishes and the naan wasn't as great as everyone posted. My fianc\u00e9 who is the meat eater wasn't too fond of the goat curry and prefers Taj Palaces chicken tiki masala. Overall, it was a good place to try for Indian food and was crowded for Saturday lunch buffet so that has to say something but we'll stick to taj palace for our Indian fix."}

The menu was huge (sometimes a bad sign) but everything we ordered & every dish that passed our table looked and smelled delicious. We had been craving Indian food, so before we stepped foot in the restaurant, we already knew we were going to order momo and chicken tikka masala. Lucky for us, Wednesday happened to be chicken tikka masala night, which means if we bought one, we'd get the 2nd one half off. (You can choose the level of spiciness you prefer.) Along with the naan, this meal really hit the spot. I'm not from the area, but I will definitely come back here anytime I'm in Vegas again just to try more tasty dishes, especially those on the prix fixe menu!"}

I went with an Indian friend and she was in heaven.  I've been to India a couple of times and the food here is as good as anything I had there.  Prices are reasonable.  Warning: if you order the Inferno curry, the waiver isn't a joke.

The vegetable korma was delicately seasoned, creamy, but we asked for medium spice, so it did have a little kick. The marinated vegetables cooked in a tandoor were spicy and smoky - too much for one person. I hear the chicken tandoor dishes were delish too. We will return. Thanks MINT!"}

Is it worth the hour long wait one time, when the line was out the door and had to wait a super long time for a lunch at 2pm on a thursday... ehh??? The buzz must have gotten out cause this place was packed for lunch.  The garlic naan is super fresh and keeps coming out when asked for.  The selections at the buffet are all tasty and good.  My go to indian food is always chicken tikka, tandori, rice and goat curry which are all good here. The tandori is not too dry (which happens often for indian buffets I noticed) and the goat curry has lots of actual goat meat.  Spicy factor is definitely there so be warned!! I also ordered a mango lassi but that was ok, I think it was a pre-made from a carton though, boo :( which is a little disappointing.  The only issue is when it's packed, the service gets a little slower and the wait is pretty long since people do not want to leave without getting more than their money's worth.  You know a place is super good when it's native people are taking over the place, not trying to be racist but this place was FULL of indians and their huge families... so it must be good right?!

{"business_id": "gkWEjZIVcrUerEzed6IKpg", "text": "I took my father here for a buffet lunch; it was his first time ever eating Indian.  The atmosphere is quiet and clean.  To be honest, I felt like this buffet equally represented cuisines from all over the continent of India.  I preferred the vegetarian dishes and rather enjoyed them and my father took a special liking to their goat curry.  Their goat is very tender and has a light gamy flavor but was seasoned well.  The vegetable korma and Pav Bhaji were excellent!!!  I would highly recommend this place if you wan't great Indian at prices half of what you would expect to pay at Tamba on the Strip."}

Ordered the malai kofta and the chicken tikka masala which both tasted very good. The naan was also very good, maybe a little fluffier in shape as opposed to flat like I am used to, but delicious. This is the best indian food I have had in town so far. Also, the interior of the place is beatiful, lit romantically and well decorated. I will go back for the lunch buffet next time. The service was good and we did not have to wait long to get our food. Dinner portions might be small to some people, i thought it was plenty of food though."}

Like I said, the food was ok...but there are other restaurants in Vegas that are much better."}

You even get a choice of naan. There are a varieties of vegetarian dishes, and a handful of meat dishes including lamb or goat and of course the usual chicken curries and chicken tandorii. Dessert is also included."}

(Even the saag was hotter than the chicken vindaloo!)  They have a large selection of beers and wine, including organic choices, and lassi cocktails.  The bill for 2 buffets and 2 glasses of Loma Larga chardonnay came to $50.  I wouldn't make a special trip here if we return to Las Vegas but I can recommend it if you are in the area and have a hankering for Indian."}

They also have inferno dished if anyone is looking for. In short if you want quick authentic indian food, this is the place."}

It was pretty pack considering it was late Sunday evening. However, we were able to get a table right away and the food came out fast. They have a huge menu that is also vegan & gluten-free friendly (I guess all Indian food). The menu is well organized and laid out with symbols next to each dish to help the diners that have diet restrictions. Almost every dish can be made into vegan or vegetarian. They also have chicken, tofu, and cheese options. We ordered the onion/cilantra paratha, organic veggie samosas, mighty momos with veggie, chicken tikka masala (Hot level 5-it was not spicy), mixed chef's killer kabob, organic alo gobi masala, monterey jack cheese naan and lastly mango and pistachio kulfi for deserts. Not 1 bad dish. Everything was very good including their chutneys. I do wish they gave more rice since they only gave us 2 small bowls to share between 3 people. They seemed to be reasonbly priced.  Our server, Ronald was great and very helpful. The ambience of the place was nice, too.  It was relaxing and calming. You know it's a good Indian restraunt when it is packed with Indian diners!

I have been there for lunch - they have a very good buffet - wider range of options than most buffets of this type, high quality ingredients, and very good mix of salads, soups, vegetarian dishes, and dishes with chicken, paneer, goat and other items.  Restaurant is very clean, service is professional, and providing fresh naan made to order as opposed to providing this on the buffet line is a nice and high quality touch.  Toughest aspect here is tight parking in the shopping center (not the fault of Mint, and can be dealt with).  Highly recommended."}

The hubby got the Mighty Momo with chicken. I didn't think they were that good and would definitely be more appropriate served as an appetizer than a main dish.

Service was really good in the beginning, we got the fried bhinda (okra) which I thought it was really good, however it started to taste more burnt than fried towards the bottom of the bowl. I got a paper dosa with cheese (they barely put any cheese inside). The dosa was crispy which I really liked. They really overdid it on the chili naan, they stuffed so many chilies inside of it that it tasted like one huge chile rather than a spicy naan. No one was able to eat that. When it came time to get the check and possibly order some dessert, there wasn't a waiter in sight. It took around 30 minutes and a lot of awkward beckoning for someone to finally come over. The area around the restaurant was ok, lots of construction and parking was a bit hard but overall the experience was good. Would come back again."}

When we finally got our food, it was very dissatisfying. $21 for overcooked dried lamb on a bed of arugula and Dijon mustard, and they didn't even offer rice. I could barely chew the lamb. My husband did the inferno challenge. Couldn't stomach it. They offered him a tiny sauce dish filled with plain yogurt to settle his stomach. They charged us $3 extra for it. I can buy a whole tub of plain organic yogurt at the grocery store for that much. Still, it was thought to be a courtesy yogurt. Lastly, one of the waiters approached our table and offered us to-go boxes. He never came back. Just ignored us completely along with our initial waiter. My husband had to walk to the counter to get the check. And I walked up later to get a box and a bag.

To start, I had prawns that were wrapped in bacon, fried (in what tasted almost like egg roll batter), and served with sweet and sour sauce. Meaty and full of flavor, I would definitely order them again. For my main course, I had the drunken noodles with sea bass--and oh my gawd, that stuff was incredible. The fish was lightly fried and crispy on the edges, but velvety smooth on the inside. The noodles were tender and intensely flavorful, especially when paired with the peppers and basil leaves that accompanied them. I asked for the dish medium spicy, and it was the perfect amount of heat--it challenged my palate, but it didn't obscure the wonderful flavor of the delicate fish. After all of that food and two Singha beers (I had forgotten how good they were), I was as full as I've been in a while.

To get your taste buds so numb that you can't taste anything.  Overall, it was good but not as good as Sripraphai in NYC.  Sripraphai may have less heat but is full on flavor."}

All I have to say is OH MAH GOT. With all of the Michelin Rated/James Beard Award restaurants on the strip, Lotus of Siam is right there at the top. NO FUCKING LIE. When you walk in, the waiting area's walls are covered with features in top notch publications such Gourmet, Bon Appetite, Robb Report, etc etc. LOS made Robb Report's top 100 restaurants on EARFFF. This meal was probably one of the top 20 dinners I've ever had.The grilled prawn (which is actually deep fried), is straight-up one of the tastiest things I have ever had. Cooked to perfection, it's fried and seasoned with garlic, salt, pepper, and secret Thailand magical flaver. The sweetness explempliflies the freshness of the prawn. I hate prawn/shrimp skin, but yet they have made the skin taste like pure delight. OH SHIT, i'm so hunga.

LoS has become my gold standard for all Thai restaurants to be compared to. Every dish I've had here has met or exceeded expectations - the balance of flavour (sweet vs. sour vs. heat, etc),  the quality of ingredients,  and the preparation. From the Drunken Noodles to the curries to the more exotic dishes like whole catfish (PLAR DOOK O-CHA)....you'll be happy you came here. This place has gotten a lot of press and tends to be more packed than when I first started going there over 5 years ago....but it's worth going to when you order off the menu. If you like heat (spice), they don't skimp. I love everything at a '10' and they always accommodate....just beware. ;) They also have a killer wine list to boot according to my wine snob brother.

This place has a good mix of tourists and locals so you know it's good.  On your next trip to Vegas, make sure you give it a try."}

The fried sea bass over drunken noodles is an amazingly good dish.  The tom yum soup was very flavorful with a nice hint of fried garlic, but even at a spiciness level of 3 out of 10 it had tiny pieces of chopped up peppers that were very spicy if you bit into them.  The fried crispy rice with sausage had such interesting textures and flavors that I never had before, but I really loved it the more I ate it.  However, we didn't have a reservation, and the wait time they quotes us was 30 minutes, but we ended up waiting over an hour to get seated.  People around us consistently had to double the wait time quoted to them by the hostess, and even people who came in with reservations often had to wait 15 minutes."}

I have been to their buffet on each of the day of the week and I have to say the quality went from one extreme to the other. For example, Tuesday would be a best day to go, when they have coconut based soup, egg omelet, et..., follow by Friday, when they have duck soup. Worst day to go would be Wednesday. By the way,  I was hesitating between 3 stars and 4 stars, but finally decided on 3 stars because their food kinda went downhill a little bit after their expansion."}

I ordered a prepared to order beef dish. Tasty but only about 3 oz of beef for $16 and insuffient amt of food unless you love small Lean Cruisine size portions. Don't know what it is but the decor.. total LACK OF..in these places puts me off. May give it another try but I liked or 4-7-2011 visit to Namaste much better and it is only a couple doors down. This is an older seedy area at N end of Strip in Commercial Center. After overkill glitz-glamour on strip it may be the place suffers big time by comparison but I would say not updated since it opened.

My biggest gripe with the meal was drunken noodle seafood use of fake crab.  If you're a James Beard award winning restaurant don't use fake crab.

And most folks who eat here love it. Having said that, I just don't get Lotus of Siam. Sure, it's good; the curries are balanced and the salads, and noodle dishes are tasty, but I feel that this is a place that is more concerned with it's reputation as the premier Thai restaurant in the area than the menu. They have tailored their dishes for farang, (foreign), meaning our milder,  palates. What is with the wine obsession? I have never experienced a Thai restaurant anywhere that directs such focus on wine. Not that it's a bad thing, I personally enjoy a glass of Pinot Grigio with a Glass Noodle Salad, for example, but it comes off to me as a little snobbish. The staff are courteous, but seem harried and too busy. The service is good, but I like to chat in Thai to my server and or hostess, and they just don't seem to have the time. Those who are seeking authentic Thai food should try some of the other Thai restaurants in town. Each one is different and I don't really have a favorite, although the beef salad at Pin Kaow is excellent, the curries at Komol Kitchen are mind blowing, (the pastes are made from scratch), and the Larb at Ocha is the best I've ever had anywhere! Order it with sticky rice. There are a few Thai places in Vegas I've not tried, mostly because of their location relative to my home, but for my money, eating Thai means enjoying the personality of the restaurant, the proprietor, & the food. In these areas, Lotus of Siam is little better than average, and the lunch buffet is the only thing I eat there if I'm on my lunch break and am in need of a quick Thai fix. I can get in and out of there in a half hour, and make it back to work on time."}

It turned out to be the best Thai food I have had in the US. I started out with some Satay, which was juicy and well seasoned and even included a delicious sweet cucumber salad. My entree was a pork stew, which wasn't hot, yet still filled to the brink with spices. I would absolutely recommend getting the sticky rice with it. I also had a couple of spoons of Tom Yum Koong soup, and it was delicious but way too hot for me, probably the hottest one I have ever had, felt like a wildfire was building up in my mouth. If you like hot food though, you should give it a try. I was too full to get dessert, however I had some nice green tea that was done exactly right, so I left Lotus of Siam smiling happily and am planning to return next time I am in the area."}

We ordered a bowl of hot and sour soup with chicken (very different from what I am accustomed to, but extremely delicious), duck curry (spicy and delicious), sweet and sour chicken (AWESOME, i ordered a batch to go after the dinner) and I forgot what the last entree was but it was chopped up pork that was very minty with flavorful spices.

Five of us shared a few appetizers and main dishes.

The waiters, even the hosts, really know their food. If you ask, they will recommend the best, and it truly is the best. I did visit their ladies restroom and I was very surprised to see a fabulously clean and well groomed restroom. Soap, toilet paper..everything was stocked. When you see the outside of the restaurant, you wouldn't necessarily think it was nice on the inside, but everything on the inside was professional including the waiters and hosts.

I wasn't familiar with much of the menu, and many dishes had oyster sauce of which I'm allergic to, but the waiter was patient and understanding and gave us some suggestions. The tum yum soup with chicken ( # 4 on his spicy scale was recommended ) it was amazing !! ,beautifully spiced , nice presentation if u r dining with 3 or more guests get the big one for a few dollars more it feeds 4 !! Big pieces of chicken and tons of mushrooms and tomato !! Next came the chicken satay, very tasty !! Than the crying tiger , thinly sliced beef it was awesome but served cold, ( as I'm not familiar with the dish, it is said that that is how it normally is served) but could have used a little warmth for my taste! Very soon our entree arrived basil crispy pork!! I could just die!! It was awesome! I requested no oyster sauce and they said they cooked it in soy sauce and chili sauce!! But the flavor was absolutely amazing!! Also the green curry was great , a little to sweet for my taste, but request the chili tray , so u can spice things up to your liking, my friend micheal ordered the minced chicken 15 star spicy, which I didn't try , but made my friend cry!! Micheal loves his spicy food!! Lol we finished by sharing a banana cheese cake which was the perfect compliement to an already great meal!! And as for micheal he has redeemed himself!!

We waited at least an hour before our waiter (who was running around working hard all night) noticed we didn't have our food.  His excuse was that the kitchen was packed.  We believed this because the restaurant was packed, but he wasn't telling the truth because other tables who were seated after us were finishing up their meals and paying their bills.  Kind of a bummer not to be comped on anything when it was clear our order was messed up somehow.  I know accidents happen, but admit it!  I still gave 4 stars because the wait staff was very nice and friendly and the food was unbelievable, unlike any Thai I've had.  I'd definitely go back!"}

Its too timid, too sweet, or just plain not great.  And Thai food should be great.  Well, last night I was transported back to the streetside restaurants of Bangkok, and ate the best Thai meal I have enjoyed since I left that jewel of a country.  Here are a few highlights: som tam - as bombing as it should be, but if you don't like spice stay away from that one!  Snow crab with ginger, apples, lime and more.  Wow!  An entire deep fried catfish that was the most perfectly fried fish you can imagine, and came served with some incredible sweet and spicy sauce; crispy duck in green curry that was the best prepared duck I have ever had (think a skin that defines crispy, succulent meat, and not a drip of fat to be found), in a super flavorful curry with bamboo shoots; Chinese broccoli with deep fried pork lardons - call the doctor!  And many other great dishes we could share with our large party.  Some of the stuff just came out from the kitchen when they realized we were not there for Pad Thai and spring rolls.  In every way, the service was exceptional, and when the bill came I could not have been more happy.  After two days of overpriced Strip restaurants that offer more flash than flavor, this was just what the doctor ordered - authentic, huge flavors and great value.  There is a good reason why so many people rave about this place.  It rocks!  Kap khun kap Lotus of Siam!"}

Best of all is an award winning wine list where many of the wines are priced below retail. We put our group in the waiter's hands, and he delivered eight or ten terrific appetizers and shared entrees, each better than the last. I took the opportunity to pillage the wine list, and although some of my selections couldn't be found, we ended up with some stunners.

I had waited two months to visit as a special occasion for my birthday and I passed up going to Ramsay's Steak House for this!  We moved here 3 months ago from Seattle  where there is an abundance of Asian restaurants so I know good Thai food!!! First, yes it's a little whole in the  wall which I was prepared for from doing my research but REALLY their sign wasn't even illuminated on the building making it difficult to even see the dang place in the dark. Then the hour long wait even though i called promptly when their doors opened that evening to make reservations and was told they where full. Finally seated, I had already chosen my entree by looking at there website and although I wanted to order 12 things I chose a fave of Moo Yang.  Had an appetizer of tempura, I have never had tempura with thick crunchy  batter.....that's not tempura. And it was suppose to be vege and shrimp, there where 4 small pieces of vege and the shrimp had been cut in half all for 10.95.  For such a huge menu was disappointing there wasn't no crab rangoons or fresh rolls on there app menu. My entre of Moo Yang was DRY almost shamefully so! No vege's  just a plate of meat that looked like it was tossed around the plate to make it appear it fllled the plate......... horrible presentation.and when the server offered me sticky rice I anxiously said yes but he failed to tell me he was going to charge me an extra 2.00. My husband had crab fried rice, rice looked like it was FRIED for maybe five seconds, just a plate of steamed rice as far as i was concerned.  Last observation I made no spices on the table!!!! Come on!!!! This place is renowned so being busy doesn't cut it!  There decor was not aesthetically pleasing especially the numerous pictures on the wall above me of chef and various clients in cheap frames and hanging crooked on the wall.

The thai fried rice was not only small, but also generic. The saving grace was the nam prik ong. Other than that, most of the menu items can be found at sanamluang in Hollywood, California (thai town). Sanamluang not only tastes better than Lotus of Siam, but also costs less and offers more portions. To be frank, I was tempted in giving this place a 2 star review. The nam prik ong was delicious, but wasn't worth the ten bucks I paid for it. The small serving of nam prik ong showed me that this place was nothing but a scam on people who can't get good thai food in Las Vegas.

I would also recommend the Drunken Crab noodle which is soft shell crab in noodles...my boyfriend's favorite!  For dessert I usually get the sweet sticky rice with fresh mango or the banana rolls.  Since you are there I would recommend that you get the Thai ice coffee or tea because it is one of the best that I have tasted.

This restaurant is surprisingly inexpensive when you consider the type of dining experience you get at other restaurants on the strip.  My favorites are the crispy rice, duck in red curry and my all time favorite is the Nua Yang Prik Thai Onn, which is sliced steak that is as tender as you can imagine, sauteed with red chili paste and peppercorns.  I go to a level seven on spicy, but I'm a little crazy.  They also have an AMAZING wine list.  My favorite pairing is the mango w/sweet sticky rice and a dessert Gewurztraminer.

This was quite simply the best Thai food I have ever experienced, by a mile, served at a fair price promptly, hot, by a friendly staff.  You can choose anything and it is fantastic,  When you go, try things off the Northern Menu for a unique and rare experience.  Someone here on Yelp said crispy duck in curry is life changing, and he/she is right.  We paired it with Panang, our favorite curry.  Breathtaking.  Crispy garlic shrimp were also mind altering.  Tom Ka Gai soup perfect.  Spicy garlic wings perfect. Scallops in red curry perfect. Khao Soi (Northern) perfect. Spicy seafood fried rice perfect.  My only regret is I know not when I will be able to go again as I live elsewhere.  If I lived there I would go several times a week.  Try it.

Amazing selection of German wine for very reasonable prices.  A perfect companion which cuts through the rich and intense flavors of many of the dishes here.  The menu is huge and I cannot claim to be an authority as an infrequent tourist, but the Nam Kao Tod is a fabulous appetizer.  Any variation of the Pad Kee Mao (particularly with crab) ordered spicy is amazing, but the my favorite dish here is the duck panang.  They fry strips of duck breast (breaded)  until crispy and then drizzle with a rich and distinctive panang which is far spicier than many editions I have had elsewhere.  Combine with a Donnhoff riesling and coconut ice cream to finish, and you have a fabulous treat of a meal...  Do not miss when in Vegas if you like Thai food."}

We also had the chicken pad thai noodles.. i know I know.. typical american dish no real thai lover would order ... now.. I understand it should be spicy and it probably is really good to you heat seekers but the not spicy version... tasted like noodles tossed in ketchup.

I ordered my food to go. I got the Larb/Pork. I was told it'll be ready about 15 minutes. I waited near the entrance and my food came. I could smell it already and can't wait to eat it. It was so good, very flavorful, the spice was right where I like it to be level 4. It was comes with cucumbers and cabbage to eat with. You can eat this with rice.

The tea was amazing. It's definitely better than Archi's. The fried rice was quite dry. I don't think I'll order it again. The good news is that the shrimp in my fried rice didn't smell fishy.

During the week they have a lunch buffet so I asked the host whether, my first time there, I should order off the menu or get the buffet.  He suggested ordering off the menu.  So I chose my normal red curry with chicken, medium heat.  The curry was good, I thought a bit mild for medium, but then I chomped down on a chunk of jalapeno that I thought was bell pepper that was not listed as an ingredient.  The only thing other than the chicken was some bamboo shoots and some basil and of course a whole jalapeno cut lengthwise. Also ordering off the menu takes a lot longer to get service and food. If I am in the area I may go to try the buffet as there seemed to be many regular customers taking part.  So far though I am very unimpressed, especially given the hype, and there are two other Thai restaurants I would prefer in Vegas."}

Don't get me wrong the food was great but not a place that I would overly try to rate or tell someone it's the best. If you want to know what hype is then this is it. If you order alacart combination fry rice you receive a cup and a 1/2 of it. Leave everyone wanting more and ordering more. Bar-b-Que chicken is actually Cornish hens. The portions are very small and this is where the trick lies. If you serve small portions you leave not completely satisfied but satisfied creating this nostalgic feeling of awesome food.

So LOS really hit the spot and somehow we managed to get a table within fifteens minutes after arriving on a Saturday night! The service was a little odd, though. We had one server who took our order and didn't come back until we paid. The rest of the time we had a busser working his tail off. We don't quite know who got the tip. Our food was delicious. We ordered green curry with beef, pad Thai with Chicken, the special mango salad with shrimp, chat broiled prawns, and saut\u00e9ed veggies. The green curry wast personal favorite and it was super spicy. I'm never sure what to expect , so we went with medium and it was definitely on the high end of medium spice. My only quibble were the portion sizes. A touch on the small side but satisfying and fresh nonetheless. I ordered a Singha to drink but their wine list is certainly expansive. I'd skip most restaurants on the strip and take the short cab ride to this place. Plan ahead and try to make a reservation. We simply got lucky with out short wait time.

My fianc\u00e9 and I have been going to Lotus of Siam every time we have gone on a Vegas trip. However, I have to say this might have been the lady trip to Lotus. The lunch buffet selection looked totally different with more Chinese food than usual and the Pad Thai, which was the one thing that I always looked forward too wasn't the same. The Pad Thai was light in color and bland. Usually, the Pad Thai is very orange and the flavorful, so flavorful that sometimes when I'm back in CA I contemplate on going to Vegas just so I can eat the Pad Thai at Lotus of Siam. Also, besides the Pad Thai being bland all the other food just didn't taste the same and was a little off. I don't know if the little Thai lady isn't cooking the food anymore because I didn't see her or maybe they sold it? But, whatever you changed Lotus of Siam, PLEASE change it back to what it use to be, it's just not the same. I'll probably try it one more time on a different Vegas trip because that's just how much I loved lotus of Siam and I hope they just had a temporary cook for the day."}

Getting recommendations from your server is good advice.  You can't go wrong as the food quality is top notch and expect some of the best Thai you've ever had.  It's a $20 taxi ride from LV strip and make sure and get reservations.  Be aware they only hold your reservation for 5 minutes, so get here early if on Fri-Sun night."}

They seated us at the bar while we waited for a table but then didn't come to offer us any beverages.  I understand that it was near the end of the shift, but close the restaurant when it is closed, not when it is almost closed.  The bartender ignored us and just went about cleaning up his area.

When we were waiting inside, we noticed the buffet option but opted to order from the menu since the lunch buffet looked basic. When the food arrived, we all agreed that the food was delicious but many other Thai restaurants down the street offer the same great taste for half the price and double the size. Food may be great but their service was horrendous. For a restaurant with such great reviews, I was surprised we had to wait 30 mins for water and made many, many attempts to gather a waiter's attention for our check. Our party left unsatisfied and made a quick stop at Mcdonalds because we were still hungry.

Ate the Drunken Noodles with soft shell crab, Massaman curry, crab fried rice, Tom Yum soup. The curry was sweeter than I've had before but was quite good. Highly recommended.

Really bustling and waiters earning their tips. Ordered a SINGHA pint and enjoyed conversation and reviewing menu with my lady.

My sister ordered the Yellow Curry and was excellent (I thought is was surprisingly mild) which we all ate portions of.  We craved more chicken wings and ordered another serving of even hotter (10 this time) and were just right. My only complaint was the servers could have removed finished dishes sooner and had to be asked to do so. My sister and her husband have lived in Las Vegas over 35 years and said this was the first time that they had been by Lotus of Siam where there was not a line waiting to get in, as they had wanted to eat here before, but had not wanted to wait in line to get in.

Finally after visiting, I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the food. The service was impeccable, and having worked in a higher end restaurant for several years, I could not find a single flaw. The food doesn't feel like it lives up to the standard of the service. I came a large group of people and we ordered the nine most popular dishes. And I must say that nothing about any of the food stood out.  I couldn't find a flaw with the taste or texture, but nothing about the food captured me. It was a bit of a let down, the food was still good, but everyone I was with felt the same way. Overall I would give it an 8.5 out of 10. If the food matched the service, it would be the best restaurant in the world."}

I give it a solid, 4, its really a 4.50 if I could cut it here, but its not 5 star yet.

My friend and I were in Vegas for 6 days for a conference and planned to come here for lunch on our last day. During lunch hours, they serve a buffet. I'm not sure what kind of food was in the buffet but it seemed very popular. We ordered off the menu and got the Nao Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, Garlic Prawns, and Roasted Duck Curry. You could adjust the spiciness for each dish. They go from scale 1-10. We decided on going with 5 for all the spicy dishes. The food took a while to come out but we didn't mind since we did come during the lunch rush. The Nao Kao Tod came first and it was a very interesting crispy rice salad. It was slightly tangy and when you eat it with the cabbage provided, it's the perfect blend of crunchy, zesty, and freshness. I have never had anything like this so I truly enjoyed it! The Tom Kah Kai came out next and this was probably my least favorite dish. I felt like the taste was off, maybe too much coconut milk? I've had better elsewhere. The Garlic Prawns were SO good! A bit pricey compared to the other dishes but the prawns were very big and juicy and were fried to perfection. The seasoning on the prawns was so delicious! The curry was the best I've ever had. The flavors were there and the duck was roasted to the perfect consistency and meshed so well with the curry. Service was great! All the waiters made sure our water glasses were full and always checked up on us. This place is definitely a spot I would need to visit everytime I'm in Vegas.

When we first pulled up, we were a little surprised by the restaurant's appearance. It's definitely not fancy, and isn't in the nicest of neighborhoods. Nonetheless, we had heard such great things about the food so we were excited to give it a try. When we walked in, the inside was pretty cute. We had quite a long wait (as other reviewers said, reservations are a good idea). We thought we'd just go to the bar and have a drink while we waited. The bartender was AMAZING. I'm very picky about wines, and she let me taste a couple before ordering the one I wanted. When a table finally opened up, the dinner service was absolutely fantastic as well. Everyone was so friendly and attentive! As for the food, it was by far some of the best Thai I have ever had. I had the calamari garlic. I love calamari, but sometimes when I order it in restaurants it's really tough and chewy. The calamari here was SO tender. The sauce was spicy and fragrant: lots of garlic and cilantro. I just wish I could have it more often! Especially for the quality of the food, the prices are incredibly reasonable. Highly recommend Lotus of Siam... just be prepared to make reservations or endure a bit of a wait!"}

Think about that for a second. I'm not saying white folk don't know their Asian food but an Asian restaurant with no Asians eating there tells you something. Food was slow to come out but service was good. They kept coming back and checking on the table. Maybe one too many times in fact but I guess it's better than bad/no service. If you are looking to try the place because it was on tv by all means. Not a whole lot of value for your buck though. You can basically get just as good or better somewhere else.

If you are visiting Vegas, invest in the cab ride out to Lotus of Siam because it is worth it! They have many dishes that you would not find at any other Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, since there were only two of us, we were only able to partake of three dishes. One was the thai sausage (they have 2, we got the one in the back part of the menu). It was spiced unlike any other sausage we'd ever had and was very tasty. We ordered pork belly and chinese brocoli (gai lan) in oyster sauce. It was a simple dish made with very fresh ingredients. The last dish we tried was drunken noodle soft shelled crab. This dish was just very tasty. I had been concerned that the medium spicy sauce we had specified would overwhelm the crab, but it just complimented the crab perfectly. The service was terrific, relaxed, informative, and attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice. It was full, but it did not feel rushed. I take off one star because of the decor. Once inside, I felt like I was in an Italian restaurant with a huge wine room. That said, I would come back again and again to work my way through their menu."}

Location sucks, but its very close to the strip, which makes it worth the visit. You cant go wrong choosing this place, if your indecisive on choosing a specific thai restaurant. Their Pepper Garlic Chicken is the best thai dish in the city PERIOD. Id also recommend their chili mint chicken. Soups are above average! The last good thing I have to say is if you order SPICY, you get SPICY, unlike other thai spots in town."}

A drink that no one seems to know about is lime tea (or that is what the Thai name is translated into). It is the Thai iced tea base but instead of bringing cream in a ramekin, it's freshly squeezed lime juice. It is so refreshing.

And after trying it out for myself I can definitely agree! Let me start with the interior, this location is sort of has an odd stand alone building in the middle of a parking lot for a shopping center. But the inside is really nice because it's like your Aunt's classic living room, which has a nice home feel to it. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was in the lunch specials part of the menu. Let me just say the best Pad Thai I've ever had! Amazing flavor! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

The chicken skewers were huge but when I bit into them it was mostly fried and dark meat which I didn't really like. At first, it was good but then the grease got to me. The cucumber salad helped with that and I had some of my sister's rice which was very flavorful for white rice. Her husband ordered a shrimp curry that looked really good. He said it was good but not as good as this other Thai place in Chicago. The place was set up really nice considering it was in a strip mall.

The onion and sweet potato tempura was good but nothing special. The spicy tuna roll wasn't that great -- possibly too much mayo and not enough tuna in the mix. The unagi with kiwi and mango had a distinct sweetness to it which was refreshing and unique but the eel may have been overcooked. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and they were incredibly quick to pick up dishes when we were done. The atmosphere was nice and cozy, esp. because they sat us right next to the only other party in the restaurant leaving the rest of the place completely empty. I dunno... I think I would have preferred a little personal space. I expected to be blown away by the food since the exec chef trained under Matsuhisa. But the whole experience was underwhelming.

The guys at the sushi bar were so fun and helpful in ordering rolls and I have to say each roll we ordered had 6 big pieces...I started to get full after 4 pieces. THe beer was cold and the way they set up the sake and serve it is FUN! The service happened so fast and elegantly that every time we looked down we had fresh plates and new ice cold beer glasses and yet we were never interupted once! We never had to look up and ask for anything! Just because the sushi chef is from Nobu doesn't mean this place has to be exaclty like Nobu. They are obviously getting a good following becasue on a Saturday night it was filling up. The T.V. at the sushi bar is fun for sporting events if you are just going to grab some sushi with a friend or with your boyfriend etc., etc. And it is a great place to take people that don't eat sushi because they have an entire menu of cooked food. My suggestion is GO! The service, sushi, ambiance, and prices are definatley worht it!

The fish was really yummy, but for me, the star of the night was the filet mignon!  Overall, a very nice time . . . I will definitely be back.

The sushi itself was pretty good. We went during happy hour (currently 10:30pm-1:30am Mon-Sat), so the prices were great. Unfortunately, to put it lightly, the service was lacking. I'm too frustrated to bother with details. I hesitated even writing this review in the first place. The bottom line for me is that there are plenty of sushi places in Vegas with good to great sushi and good to great service. I don't need to return. Luckily for SoJ, they have enough of a following (100+ reviews) that my lowly 1-star won't affect their stellar average at all."}

I told the sushi chef to serve me the good stuff but I am not sure if that comment mattered since nearly all of the meal came from the kitchen.  The least disappointing course was the sushi!

We also ordered the cold noodles and my husband and I didn't like as much as the hot one, but it was a good experience.  The rolls are very good.  The waitress was friendly and helpful.  This place is expensive, but it worth every penny.  The desserts here are okay.  Nothing special.  Overall, my husband and I loved this place and we will be back everytime we in Vegas.  Highly recommended this place."}

Our server was excellent and so friendly and the chef even visited our table to greet us. The sushi was expertly prepared and beautifully plated. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. The scallop with the lime sauce was excellent and I loved the unique rolls that included things such as apes and balsamic or crab and curry. And don't forget dessert. The best almond cake and chocolate souffl\u00e9 with green tea ice cream finished off the wonderful meal."}

The fish was fried just right, was not overcooked and they they did pick the right size for our party of 6. There was even left over fish. We all thought that the fish looked a little small on the plate, but let me tell you, it was kind of deceiving. It was like a never ending fish. Al the veggies were fresh. The shrimp paste wrapped around the sugar cane was also very delicious. We also had the Bo Tai Chanh and it actually came with a very interesting sauce. Fish sauce with wasabi. I'm not a big of the burning in my nose, so I opted not to use the dipping sauce. Without the sauce the the Bo Tai Chanh was still very good. this restaurant also has the 7 beef serving, which i will definitely try next time. The service was attentive and they made sure we had enough wrappers for our spring rolls and that our glasses were filled. It's nice to find a Vietnamese restaurant that serves all these types of dishes. Usually you find one, but not the other. I think the drive is so worth it to have great food and will definitely come back here when I am in town."}

They have a great customer reward program where you get 10 percent off your entire check anytime you go. My boyfriend and I ate their four times one week! We've stopped that now and just go like normal people, once a week, once every two weeks. I leave Bamboo Bistro feeling better compared to leaving Pho 8, I think it's because the food is lighter despite the same volume. Healthier I guess. Let's just say the quality of food (healthier, more veges offered) and the 10 percent discount keeps us coming back."}

It was pretty yummy. My boyfriend had the Pho with beef and meatballs. He said it was good too. The service though was a bit lacking. There was a lady there who seemed like she worked there but was too busy socializing with her friends sitting at another table. The other three guys, though very polite and friendly, were just there to mainly take your drink and food order and bring it out. We waited for about 10minutes without a refill of our empty water glasses. No one checked on us otherwise to see if we enjoyed the food or needed anything else. We had to wave down one of the guys to get refills and then later to get our check. Would I go back? Yes, but probably for take out only.

Normally after pho I don't eat anything else because pho is so filling and the peanut butter pho only comes in a large bowl but I ate that entire dessert.

The parking at Fort Apache is typical strip mall parking while the one in Chinatown is less convenient.  You have to park around the corner and walk.  The one of Fort Apache has more room, is cleaner, and newer.  Also, I love food that is very hot (spicy).  I asked for 7 our of ten and it nearly burned my lips off.

I ordered the Thai Style Tom Yum noodle soup with rice vermicelli only because my wife said the Tom Yum was good.  I don't really care for Tom Yum flavour and the rice vermicelli.  I don't think it was a good combination with this type of soup.  So I guess I was a little disappointed with this dish.  I also tried to order their duck fried rice, but to my dismay, they ran out of duck, so I had to settle for the crab fried rice instead.  The fried rice did have real crab meat in it, but there weren't that many pieces and the flavour of the crab was not infused into the fried rice, so again I was disappointed.  But then I saw the table next to me was eating the rad na with what looked like wonton noodles and it looked good.  So on a separate occasion, I ordered the rad na to take out.  Now this dish was quite flavourful. Redemption!!  There was just the right amount of gravy in there and although the greens turned a little yellow by the time I got home to eat it, the texture of the gai lan was still good.

Since I have been to Volcano before, they are really good if you ask me. The place is small, walked in looked @ the menu, and decided on the larb beef salad. Total with tax was 7.55. I had Larb Salad before @ this place in Austin Tx. and it was to die for. but this salad was pretty small for 7$, and very plane tasting. It had a decent size of meat in there compared to the rest of the salad but for 7$ they could ad more veggies @ least. Veggies aren't that expensive, and put better dressing or something. I doubt I will be back here. Total loss 8.55 cause I tipped the waiter. They waiter filled my water, n it's not his fault the food sucks. The people there where decently nice. IDK maybe I'm just a picky eater compared to the rest of Vegas, in my opinion good food in VEgas is VERY hard to find unless your spending 50$ @ a fancy casino buffet.

Service is good. I had the Panang salmon avocado which came with rice, I think it was around $10. Ordered it medium spicy, which was really not spicy for me, but it was delicious. I wouldn't initially think hot avocado as something I would like but it works really well in this dish.  I love that they give you a lot of sauce to because I like soaking the sauce up with the rice. Also, the salmon was a pretty decent size, 3 pieces maybe 1 1/2 inches by 3 inches or so, I was very full by the time we were done. We also had the combo appetizer platter, the satay was good and the food on the app was tasty but most of it was fried so I probably would opt for the pot stickers next time.

I still love the food here but will be going to Noodle house 2. The location is better & staff is more nicer."}

I had asked the waitress if they had anything that would make our food spicier, and the lady said no.  Too bad for me...I love super spicy food.  Anyway, both items tasted pretty good.

This place has NEVER had good service, they want you to come in, eat quickly and leave. But people didn't care because the food WAS really good. WAS. There special potstickers are amazing because there are no other restaurants that can emulate it and it's one dish that is still decent. However, I used to come here all the time for Duck Fried Rice and Duck Noodle Soup, but every time I come back, the quality of the duck is terrible and it keeps getting worst. The duck used to be super moist and delicious to eat, but now its super hard, dry and tough to eat and it really takes away from the whole dish itself. Now, I also stopped by to order a Shrimp Fried Rice togo and I was disappointed to open the box that wasn't even half full.....I paid full price for not even half a dish. Not only was it half empty, but there was only 4 shrimps. This place has terrible service, but the food is the only thing that gets people to come back, if the quality of the food keeps going down, people are gonna stop coming.

Prior to coming to Las Vegas, I read a very small article on Travel and Leisure magazine about this place.  Since it was up the street from the hotel I am staying, this trip transported me to Japan via a strip mall.  I got in just as it opened and welcomed me ( in japanese) .  Being the first customer there I recognized this is a small place(31 seats). Reservations are a must .  But when you get in, be prepared to be amazed by the food presented at the table ( or bar).  Anything  that you order will astound your taste buds, especially if  you order from the specials menu. Their signature item is the agedashi tofu- tofu made in house with dashi broth, tiny mushrooms, fish eggs and a little hot sauce on rim of the bowl.  This will redefine what tofu should taste like- soft and silky smooth.  The kobe beef skewers were awesome: two skewers, one laced with garlic, the other  in miso.  But the third special item, negi toro, was sublime (toro chopped up fine to a near paste); combined with real wasabi and homemade soy sauce(yes, homemade, not kikkoman).

The pork cheek, simple tofu salad, chicken stuffed mushroom, and kobe with wasabi were also winners. For desert we had a heavenly brown sugar pudding.  And the ton of  food we ordered was super cheap, especially considering the prices on the strip. They offer wine and saki flights, and the service is friendly and helpful. Those out on vacation should take a moment off the strip, it's worth it! And of course the locals hit the jackpot here."}

Had the tendons, which tastes similar to Korean BBQ but the texture of jello. The taste was awesome, but the texture turned me off a little. Asparagus and mushroom w bacon was good but nothing spectacular. The bacon was soft and the dish seemed like something one can whip up in the kitchen. The green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is heavenly!! Loved it and would come back for that and Kobe beef skewers =) the restaurant feels claustrophobic and I felt it wasn't a great date restaurant but more for a small group of four good friends. The sake sampler of 3 sake for $14 was not worth it for me. I would like to try this restaurant again because my friend is such a fan. Will update my review!"}

I will never go to Vegas again without stopping here to have some more of it. Also the foie gras was excellent, as were the Kobe Beef, the pork belly, sashimi, everything.  The service was friendly and efficient; the wait staff were happy to explain menu items in detail; what they did not do was tell us the price of the specials on the board as they described them.  We foolishly ordered one of each, only to find when we got the check that they had each been $32!  They also charged me $30 each for my two glasses of house chardonnay.  That part we were able to straighten out, but I wonder about people who don't check their bill carefully.  i wouldn't like to think that they make this kind of error too often.  The food though, was to die for and the friendliness of their farewells to every party made this a wonderful experience over all.  Ordering all the specials at $32 each was our mistake, we should have asked the price I guess.  Each of the specials was perfect so we were happy to have had them anyway."}

The 2 veg that I ordered were the asparagus and the enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon. Both were delicious, but add bacon to anything and it tastes better. The foie gras was amazing and I wanted to order 5 more of those things. Not that they were small, but it's just that damn good. I've had foie gras before but the portion size was massive compared to a lot of places I've been. While chatting it up with the chef at the bar, he slid me a bowl of clam on the house. I will definitely become a regular anytime I pass through Vegas again.

We had a great selection off the menu but nothing moved us and we are doubtful to return.  If you want to try a Japanese Grill for the experience, it is worth going.  In our party of three, no one said they would return as nothing was memorable.  One last thing, if you order off the Chef's special menu do not be surprised at the bill as the prices are not listed.

This small, cozy, reservation-only place is off the hook!! (excuse my slang, I just don't know any other ways to put it) I thought Ichiza was the only late night Japanese hang out place in Vegas, but I was wrong! This place serves authentic Japanese food for very reasonable price, just like Ichiza, but in more sophisticated style. I have ordered Foie Gras, Oden, Raku-Tofu, Agedashi-Tofu, Green Tea Creme Brulee, and Brown Sugar Flan. Everything tasted far beyond my expectation. Servers took time to explain how to eat every dish, and my tea cup was never empty for no more than 5 minutes. Great service! You can tell they put no weird chemicals to boost up the flavor, and food was simple, genuine, healthy, and marvelous. As soon as I've heard this place is reservation-only, I put their phone number in my phone... that's how much they've blown off my mind. Will definitely repeat."}

We ordered so much food but the most memorable was the Agedashi tofu.  I think it's housemade.  There's a subtle sweetness to the tofu that leaves me wanting more and more.  Dinner for two was around $150.  I recommend making a reservation since the place is small and usually packed.  I prefer the robata grill items over the sushi.

The sake tasting is a great way of accessing the sake menu.  My only quibble is that I'd put a reasonably priced domestic sparkling wine on the list (Roederer Brut, Roederer Brut Rose, Domaine Carneros) because the French ones are off the charts price-wise (delicious choices, but I'm not ordering Dom P), and the domestic choices were not great.

Our next order included grilled rice balls which proved to a real yawner ($5, 2Forks), juicy fried chicken ($9, 4.5 Forks) and a very micro sized piece of yellowtail with soy sauce ($5, 3 Forks).

We did request some things to be included in the prefix menu, kobe beef skirt steak, duck, and the crunchy asparagus.  I gotta say this trip was better than last.  We had over 10 dishes each.  The pork cheeks and skirt steak were awesome, though I recommend dipping it in the sauce it comes with for extra flavor.  All in all, every dish that came out was good.

I've heard so many good things about this place so I had to see for myself.  Overall we had a good meal an I'd love to come back again.  The Juicy deep fried chicken was just that.......juicy.  It was sooo good.  And the skin was very crispy still yet.  Agedashi tofu wad also excellent.  That dash/soy broth was amazing.  The Butter sauteed scallop with soy was also amazing as well.  The Kobe skirt with garlic was great as well with the perfect amount of garlicky goodness in each bite.  A few dishes didn't quite do it for us though.  The chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin....meh.  The Kurobuta Pork cheek wad tougher than I had imagined it shouldn't been.  And the Grilled rice ball in broth ( we ordered it with Salmon) had a touch too much Shiso flavor for me.  Overall, we enjoyed the meal and will let my parents know about this place for the next time they travel to Vegas."}

After dining here for six straight dinners, I was starting to think of myself as a squatter.  Tip: If you order the foie gras dish, ask for a small order of rice to mop up the over the top delicious sauce that this dish is served with, as you won't be able to scoop it up with your chopsticks.  Well, I tried for four nights and was ready to give up and simply lick the plate when one of the servers suggested the rice.  Nice call!"}

All she had to say was no nicely. But instead we were ignored for 10 mins and then rudely told all tables were full til closing...all without eye contact and her nose up in the air.

Surprisingly, some of the simpliest dishes were the best including bacon wrapped tamatoes and mushrooms.  I had the poached egg with ikura and uni just to try something on the expensive side.  Good but not much more spetacular than what you'd expect from such ingredients.  The stars of the night was the lamb chops, kurobota pork cheeks, and agedashi tofu...in that order.  Everything else was still good but I may come back next time and get nothing but lamb chops.    Will definitely go again as there were plenty on the menu still to be tried."}

I feel they could have sat me down and I could have ordered my Three favorite things and been gone before anyone else sat down.

Although he did have a little bit more enthusiasm with the table next to us. He checked on everyone else but us only to take our order and when we did called him over. I tried to even give them a bit of time to come, i understood that they were bz.It took us 20 minutes to get our check, only bc I had finally grab someone's attention. And she cleared our table first before getting our check, which took another ten minutes on top of the 20 it took to get someone over!! I brought my children and I felt like they stereo typed us ahead of time bc of that. We always leave 18-20% grat.  Sometimes even more! But they set themselves for this one!

Expecially if you get the fish.   Is it worth it?  Depends.   If you are starving and on a budget, go somewhere else.   If you are not on a budget, and want to try great bite-size food items, go to Roku.   P.S.  Make a reservation.   Sometimes they make people wait even if there is an open table.  Not sure if they do this to give an impression or not.  But I saw 2 or 3 groups be asked to come back in 40-50 minutes and then be sitted at the same empty table that was there when they arrived.

Very delicate! Poached egg with sea urchin and ikura was very tasty and super duper fresh! Chicken teba wing was juicy and crispy on the outside, nice. Kurobuta pork cheek was the best, tender and not too salty, and crispy. Oden was just ok, I had better one. The butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce was devine (a bit small for $7). We came at 11:30 midnight because they were super small and busy. A lot of items were sold out, so bummed. We wanted to try the juicy fried chicken, steamed foie gras egg custard, kobe beef tongue, oyakodon, green soba, the little hot pot on small fire stove, and crispy fried shrimp. Oh, they had 2 bathrooms, the prettiest I have ever seen! The sea ocean theme with aquarium and nice ocean ceiling, lighting and wall, and nice bedat seat. The other bathroom was a jungle theme with rose petals, big tree trunk and leaves flowers ceiling, with bird chipping music, so soothing! A definite must try in Vegas!!!!"}

The good thing about the restaurant is that when you order one dish, they cooked it in a variety of different ways, and you'll end up getting more and more dishes coming.

We weren't familiar with a lot of the items or authentic Japanese dining, so we had to enlist the staff for help. They were great with suggestions on what and how to order. Raku makes their own tofu, so we started with a 1/2 order of their most popular one. It was delicious. We selected a large variety of meats and vegetables from the grill. Apparently, Raku imports their coals for the grill from Japan. Whatever they're doing, they need to keep doing. Everything was delicious. My favorites were the garlic Kobe steak and bacon wrapped tomatoes. My husband loved the yellowtail tuna. Everything comes out on 2-3 bite skewers and is arranged in order of lightest to heaviest. We probably ordered 7-8 meats and 3-4 vegetables along with 2 half orders of tofu and left very full."}

Some of it, like the foie gras, was a little rich for my taste, but quality nonetheless. We had two desserts (cheesecake and creme brulee), neither of which was anything to write home (or Yelp) about. Also, the wine pours are either done by someone with poor depth perception or possibly Japan has a different definition of a glass of wine, as they were stingy with the grape juice. With as popular as this place is (reservations are a must), I am not sure why they do not open a larger location, as the current one is cramped and not very inviting. The service was adequte, but not overly nice or accommodating. Focus on the small plates, and keep the rest in the periphery."}

It was amazingly delicious!!!! I also recommended the Pork Cheek!!! A bit fatty, but nevertheless, super delicious!!! For Izakaya type food, it could not get any better than this. However, i highly suggested that you phone in a few days in advance to make a reservation. It also might take about two hours to finish your meal!!! Totally worth it though!! I will be coming back for more!!!"}
{"business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw", "text": "Drove here right after watching Las Vegas episode of Unique Eats on Cooking Channel. I've tried agedashi tofu from Japan, Korea, Cali, TX and some more in between and had better agedashi tofu but when Raku said it was homemade tofu it was just that, an awesome HOMEMADE agedashi tofu. Snapper collar was crispy almost to the perfection that didn't need any additional seasoning, chicken skewers bursted with charcoal grilled flavors. My fav. chicken with skin skewer.  Although I'm little disappointed that chefs are rushed by customers demands and they can't fully show their potential, definitely will visit again when its less busy."}

I always describe it as the best Agedashi tofu I have ever had in my life.  So I came here this past weekend just for a light late night snack ordering their foie gras, foie gras custard, bacon wrapped tomatoes and of course their Agedashi tofu.  All the dishes were great and as I remembered from the last few times I visited, but the Agedashi tofu was off for once.  It was not silky smooth on the inside as it normally is.  Hopefully that was just a one time quality control thing.  Overall it was still a great experience and I would still recommend everyone to come here just to try their Agedashi tofu if nothing at all."}

The agedashi tofu is great, and I swear they import the Asahi straight from Japan (Japanese beer in this country is really watered down). Stuck mostly with the yakitori, so can't say much about the sashimi but he seems meticulous so I'm sure it's great. Be prepared to spend some $$ if you're looking to get full though. Otherwise plan a trip to In-N-Out on your way home lol."}

The server had told me that I was lucky to even to get a seat in the restaurant and that they were booked until close, but let me tell you that the wait was well worth it. Every dish I tried had a good combination of flavors and was cooked to perfection. They had a Chilean sea bass on special that was grilled and coated with their home made teriyaki sauce with a side of daikon, hamachi Kama (my fav), all the skewers i tried were delicious, green tea br\u00fbl\u00e9e w green tea ice cream!?

Not a place I'd normally visit on my own so was excited to try some different food. I tried pretty much everything that wasn't fish on the a la cart menu and with the exception of the fried shrimp I was happy or delighted. The fois gras was the highlight - I ordered a second round. Actually the sake was the real highlight and the wait staff was the second best highlight. My companion knows good sake and ordered each of us a glass of his favorite and it knocked my socks off. When he then asked about ordering a small bottle of a different sake the wait staff steered him clear of it, which was a classy move. Things that knocked Raku down from five stars: at the time my companion reconfirmed the reservation which he'd made months in advance he was  warned that they needed to turn over the table by 8pm and we'd need to vacate - definitely not a classy move. Second, their menu was out of date - when I ordered dessert I was told the item had been discontinued for some time. On the plus side, we were steered to Raku's sister dessert restaurant in the same plaza and had a five-star experience there - yes, even better than Raku!"}

All of the dishes were exceptionally fresh and each respective dish tantalized our palates. Their dishes were exceedingly simple, yet complex and robust in taste.

Just not as good as Nobu in my opinion when in Vegas, nor as good as the hype it has received on t.v. lately. However, we are not contemplating sushi because Raku does not serve any sushi, sashimi yes. And the fish is unique species and entirely fresh and beautifully presented! So, this is really apples to oranges. What Raku does offer is a very perfected version of grilled Japanese cuisine. The homemade tofu and soy are unrivaled, bar none anywhere. So, if you like these things please come here to try the best. Their sake selection is good, too. And the roasted green tea after my meal was exceptional quality. So, why only 4/5 stars? Well, my glassware - both water and sake vessels were smelly. I am serious. This really left a mark on my otherwise near perfect meal. Sorry,  but this is not an acceptable missed detail when striving to the best in a category of dining. However, with this being said, I would return to try yet other items I had not been hungry enough to try on my first visit."}

{"business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw", "text": "This was the best dinner I have had in YEARS. We were very lucky to get a reservation at the last minute, the hostess was very sweet and accommodating! The space itself is small, tastefully decorated, and feels like a step outside of Vegas entirely- it's quietly luxurious, with intimate tables and dimmed lighting. The minute we sat down, our waiter came over and explained the specials, one of which we decided to order, the Sukiyaki. We started with the Raku Tofu, which you would have to be crazy not to try. It is unlike anything I have ever experienced. The wait staff explain how best to enjoy it (first with some Green Tea salt, then with some ginger, green onion, and bonito flakes with a bit of soy sauce), and it is unbelievably delicious and silky. Even if you don't usually like tofu, I highly recommend trying this! We also tried the agedashi tofu, which was equally delicious and served in a perfectly seasoned broth with nori flakes and salmon roe, and a little spot of chili sauce on the side of the bowl to be used sparingly. Next we tried the kobe beef with garlic, which was another huge hit- incredibly flavorful, tender, just perfect. I am no steak expert, but my boyfriend is, and he was just as blown away as I was. We had the crispy deep fried chicken, which was served on top of a bed of spinach dressed with what I think was a soy vinaigrette- amazing. Then came the duck in a balsamic soy glaze, which is another MUST-order here- again, completely unlike anything I've ever tasted. We shared one stuffed small portobello, which was outstanding, and then came the sukiyaki. If they have this special when you visit, I cannot recommend it highly enough. It comes with eggs, which you crack into your own bowl and then use as a dipping sauce- I didn't do that part, but the sukiyaki itself was just unreal. The broth was perfect, not too salty but by no means bland, and there were noodles, tofu, greens, japanese eggplant, and the most amazing, thin sliced beef either of us had ever tasted. We made the mistake of ordering one too many things, and by the time the grilled rice balls (aka onigiri but without the nori) arrived, we were both right on the verge of being too full. If you are a fan of really high quality rice, you will love these- one is brown rice and flavored with bonito flakes, and one is white rice with a shinto leaf wrapped around it. Both are of course fantastic, but for us they weren't the stars of the evening the way the tofu and beef had been. And of course it wasn't over, we ordered the fluffy cheesecake- both of us gasped when we tried it. It is like eating a cheesecake cloud. It is the lightest, fluffiest cheesecake that exists on earth, I am sure of it. Even if you decide to follow up your meal with a trip to Sweets Raku (it was closed when we went, otherwise we probably would have gone- next time for sure!), this is another must. On top of the beyond amazing food, they have a fantastic wine and sake list, and the service was truly exceptional. Warm, attentive, prompt, helpful- it felt like we were being spoiled! I seriously can't recommend Raku highly enough. We will be coming back ALL THE TIME!"}

They are hands down probably the busiest mom and pap sushi restaurant in all of Las Vegas so for reservation just forget about it and try to walk in also trying to call them is impossible since they are nearly closed 80% of the day. Ok the sushi however is just phenomenal I mean fresh well cut and extremely inventive. Then they have the sweets place what a change sooo nice. Make sure you make res before you show"}

The best flavors came from the fried shrimp, although you have to peel it, it was so tasty.  Scallop was so tasty presentation was nice as it came in the shell still.

Wanted a good omakase so I went on yelp and found this place, also a couple of my friends who has been here before recommended and told me I should not miss it if I am ever in town. We were unable to get a reservation at first because it was full, I got sad so my friend called and talked to them and finally we got a reservation! I was super happy and Raku did not disappoint!

High quality sashimi esp. the scallop; it had a sweet fruity flavor with a hard flan-like texture. Foie gras bowl was perfectly prepared. Service was attentive. Do try all the condiments on the table, esp. the chili infused oil and green tea salt."}

If you are in a group, it would be good to get at least one omakase.  We have been going there for the past 4 years everytime we visit LV, and its been consistent everytime."}
{"business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw", "text": "Disappointed. We were a party of two locals who inquired about the higher end Omakase menu - we were promised caviar, foie gras and kobe. We got 2 out of the 3 (caviar and foie gras) but watched the table of 6 next to us (5 out of 6 non-locals) who ordered the same higher end Omakase menu receive more and better quality dishes including a wagyu with egg dish. When we inquired about the disparity, we were told that the Omakase was based on the size of the table. However everything we saw the neighboring table receive, was on the regular a la carte menu so the refusal to serve us the Wagyu with egg and the fatty tuna dishes (especially after the server confirmed we had both ordered the high end Omakase) was surprising and perhaps, insulting given that we had been served a basic (ie bland) skewered filet from the Robata portion of the menu.   It's clear that someone needs to remind Raku that there are many options in town and clearly us non-food critic locals need to look elsewhere to get our authentic Japenese fix."}

I'm from San Francisco which is a pretty high culinary bar.  This place exceeded my expectations from the decor, to the service, to the food!  KUDOS!  I loved the Kobe tendon (could've eaten 5 but settled on sharing 2).  We loved the foie gras, Kurobuto pork cheek, buttered scallop, Agedashi tofu, asparagus/bacon, fried chicken, etc...  I don't think you can go wrong with anything here!  We didn't try the soups, Sukiyaki, or raw fish."}

I have eaten here about ten times now, and it is a pretty new restaurant, so that is saying something--especially since I am a very picky eater.  At lunch you can either have the buffet or order from the menu; at dinner you order from the menu.  Many of the items on the lunch buffet vary from day to day--some days there will be chana masala, some days vegetable korma, etc.  It's always great.  I actually like ordering from the menu better, though.  The owner is a very nice guy and works hard to make sure his customers have everything they need.  I have introduced several people to this place, and they all come here regularly now.  And some of them are pretty picky people, too."}

I have lived in Vegas for half a decade already and this is by far the best indian buffet restaurant in Vegas. The price is reasonable (8.99), but the food is what made them apart from other indian places. The tandoori chicken was flavorful and moist ( other places tends to have dried out chicken) and the curries were awesome. They removed the bone from the chicken and lamb curries so it was so much easier to eat and not bite into one of those small bones. So many other varieties, so little time and stomache space. =)"}

He scowls if people ask for another round of nans.Thankfully his cellphone did not go off while we were there...And rice pudding as a desert! I can't remember when a Indian resturant got away with pulling that stunt off. India has so many wonderful deserts and surely rice pudding is somewhere down at the bottom of that list....If you have to eat Indian in LV, maybe this would be my recommendation just because others are worse (Mint-ok, Origin-terrible)"}

I've ate at some other places like San Francisco where they don't give you too much meat on the chicken, but this place in Vegas is really good. To tell if an Indian restaurant is any good is if they can't make the most common, typical Naan and chicken tikki masala taste good that Indian restaurants are famous for, then I advise you run away and head for the hills!

Our server, which I believe was also the owner, was incredibly nice and sincerely thankful for our business.

In fact, their saag is so incredibly tasty that we suspect it is prepared with MSG. The wifey gets very sleepy after consuming MSG so we generally avoid it, but yet we keep coming back for more. Although the ambiance needs refreshing and their naan is too doughy for our taste, overall this is the best tasting place in town."}

Indian food is my favorite and my boyfriend and I are very judgmental diners. I'm not sure I've had better Indian food than this. The only suggestion I would make is to use larger shrimp.

They have a nice selection of meats too. I've NEVER seen a lunch buffet serve goat meat. Gotta give the props on that one. The naan is fresh and fluffy.

This place was really great. The flavors were great and very fresh. I agree with all the reviews. I do think the service was a bit slow. It seemed the hostess was also taking orders and closing tickets.  We had a show to go to so we literally had to take the check up to the register to pay our bill.

Stumbled upon this place on yelp and due to the great reviews I decided to give this place a shot. We were greeted and sat immediately. The food on the buffet looked pretty good so we went with that. Oh boy, what a good life decision that was! Just about everything I put on my plate was above average in flavor. Usually at an indian buffet there are at least 2 items that get left on my plate...Not here, the only thing I didn't care for was the potato samosas, and that's strictly due to the too thick, not crispy pastry surrounding the well spiced potato filling. The butter chicken was good,made with a mix of white and dark meat,and had a nice deep flavor throughout the chicken and sauce.  The paneer palak was wonderful and flavorful with a kick of chilies, My partner in crime enjoyed the veggie Korma greatly, as did I, it was creamy, with well rounded flavors and tasted very unique compared to other veggie kormas I've had. Heck it put mine to shame! They didn't shy away from spice or heat as some indian places do to adapt to American palates and I dig them for it. Service was a bit slow, plates weren't cleared as fast as I would've liked them to be, and my water glass was parched a few times but I'll cut them some slack for being a bit short staffed the day we went. Overall it was great!"}

The restaurant was quite clean and the service was friendly and prompt despite the restaurant being more than half occupied.  I can't recommend getting their thali combos enough.

The best dish, however is a toss up between their chili chicken and rice pudding dessert. For very different reasons each dish is Tasty. The chili chicken has heat and a delectable blend of spices. The rice pudding is just sweet enough and a refreshing end to a meal filled with spicy goodness. If you're a fan of Indian cuisine or first timer, I'd suggest you try this place.

The waiter simply asked if I like spicy (no number game), and the dish was the just the right amount to get your tongue tingling, but not overwhelming.

This place really reminded me of home cooked food. The owner and the servers were really attentive and made sure we always had naan and water on our table. They cleared out plates as soon as we were done. Because it was new years, the owner came and gave me and my friend a rose stem each and wished us a happy new year. It was a great gesture!

I will give it another shot if I am in the area, but I don't see myself driving out of the way to eat here. Their buffet is fairly limited and most of the food lacked ANY spice factor. It was almost bland and some of it was overcooked. My favorite part was the rice and the naan. I did finish my small plate and had no desire for seconds. The meats were fatty and low quality and the buffet was not exactly cheap at $10.99 + tip. The owner seems like a nice gentleman and recognized my friend who worships this place. The service however was close to non existent and toward the end we felt rushed. I am a fan of Indian food and have sampled several places around town, and this would probably stack somewhere in the middle. I would be interested in trying their dinner items to see how they stack up in that category. Overall, just an okay Indian buffet with not much separating it from the rest of the pack other than the owner who seems to care about his return patrons."}

We ordered a bottle of wine and a few various dinners and naan, which we did wait a little while to actually receive, but it was so worth the wait. Everything was amazing!

The husband and I literally drove from Phoenix straight to Mount Everest for the lunch buffet. This buffet was no joke, the food on it was very good. We both felt it was one of the best Indian buffets we had been to. So much so, that I ate a ton of food and couldn't eat another thing for the rest of the day. Standout dishes were the chickpea curry, the sweet rice (never seen this before!), and the warm carrot dessert.... so tasty! The chicken tikka masala wasn't the best I'd ever had. Complaints include: we finished a full plate of food before getting the opportunity to ask for naan (they didn't bring any to us), our booth was in a weird corner you had to squeeze into, and their women's bathroom wasn't super clean (although I imagine that was from a recent customer and not due to a general lack of cleanliness).

My friend got that as well and liked hers. The hubby liked his curry, too. We had exceptional service that night. Where they get downgraded is that they without a doubt served me leftover saag from the lunch buffet. The spinach was browned like it had been left under a heat lamp all day, it had tell-tale paneer in it that they missed removing even though I ordered it plain, and it was spicy as hell even though I ordered it mild.

We ordered Saag with Lamb, butter chicken, tandoori chicken and garlic naan. The least favorite was the tandoori chicken. Not that anything was wrong with it, but because everything else was so damn delicious that the tandoori chicken was the only thing left over. This is our new go to place for indian food. I will 100% return"}

I dream about it. The owner is so down to earth and nice. He always recognizes me and my family and is so kind to us.

The vindaloo was a little disappointing as the flavor profile never showed up; it was also very tame for a vindaloo, especially when I asked for a 7/10 spice level.  The Bhindi, on the other hand, was perfect; this is the ONLY way I'll eat okra; it was tender and cooked just right, with the carmalized onion, fresh chopped tomato and spice mix = tremendous."}

Me and my fiancee came here for V-Day after hearing it was one of the most romantic restaurants in Vegas.  The location (Sahara and Commercial Center) is a bit of a grungy area but we go there to eat at Komol's quite often so the less than romantic exterior didn't bother me too much.  The interior is dimly lit and pretty cozy as well.  We got seated right away and had our orders taken within the next 10 minutes.  We had a vegetable (carrot, onion, and parsley) ensemble for our starter dishes which was quite spicy but very tasty.  I also had the vegetarian stir fry which was brought out on a steaming hot plate and smelled just as good as it tasted!  This dish had a typical stir fry 'onion-y' taste and came complete with cauliflower, red and green peppers, grilled tofu, and more parsley.  My main dish was a vegetarian curry and it was awesome!  I also had garlic naan and kashmiri naan which was also killer!  The kashmiri naan was naan with a cherry-like filling and it wasn't too sweet, complementing the buttery naan exterior very nicely.  I also had the rice pudding for dessert and it was standard like other rice puddings I've had before.  Food aside, the service was pretty good.  They were a bit slow in bringing our food out and that was a bit irritating.  We were there for almost 2 hours and we are definitely not slow eaters!  They got my order wrong three times during our visit.  The wine was the wrong one and decided to let that one slide but they brought out the wrong appetizer and wrong curry.  Still not sure how that happened, but I let them know I got the wrong dishes and they gladly replaced them with the right ones and pretty quickly, at that.  They also added a 10% percent discount on our bill and gave us extra naan.  Now that's service!  We didn't ask for the discount or naan so that was a real pleasant surprise.  They had a Valentine's special going so 4 dishes and a dessert with a glass of wine came out to be $40 a person which was actually pretty good considering the regular prices of the plates which averaged around $12 dollars each.  Overall, the service was a little slow but good and the food was awesome.  Definitely coming back to experience Namaste again in the future."}

Oh yeah!  But it got even better, several minutes later, he brought us a freshly cooked plate of uttapam - yes you read that right!   We love South Indian snacks and it's just not so easy to find that here in Vegas.  That little touch pushed us into masala bliss!

The restaurant is covered with Halloween decorations right now, its kinda funny.  The food is really inexpensive.  We ordered bul-gogi for $10 bucks which is normally $20 bucks elsewhere, but the food was so so.   We also ordered yuh-ke-jang (a spicy beef soup) and it wasn't all that great.

They didn't ask how spicy I wanted it which the other places I've been to usually did. It was spicy but not too spicy. It was just right for me.

It's hard to find these types of places anywhere else but in LA Ktown, but this one in the Southwest of Las Vegas definitely reminds me of home. I definitely have to go back again with friends, as it is a place to hang out for a good few hours, eating and drinking.

{"business_id": "G6mZKMiDqHDgH92IOg9QhQ", "text": "Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of Korean food.  My girlfriend likes this place and I like to see her happy, so we go often.  This is her favorite Korean restaurant in Vegas, where we live.  There is plenty of parking.  The atmosphere is pretty cool.  We always sit in a booth.  Each booth has walls that go all the way up creating privacy and a sense if intimacy.  The servers are friendly, helpful, and clean.  Korean pop music and a little Korean rap provide additional cultural ambiance.  Popcorn tea is served before you order.  Its a little weird, but definitely reminds me of popcorn.  Various side dishes come out with every meal.  A lot of pickled stuff.  The only one I can name is kimchi.  My girlfriend loves the hot kimchi soup.  I'm starting to like it too.  I like to pour it over rice.  By the way, they never seem to give me enough rice.  My favorite entree here is the galbi.  Probably because it is closest to stuff I normally eat.  It is BBQ ribs sliced very thin and served on grilled vegetables on a hot skillet.  The bulgogi is also pretty good.  Thin sliced meat served in a soup.  We ordered the fried calamari once.  It was pretty good, but had a lot of garlic.  Once we tried Korean style sushi.  It was okay.  Another time we tried a seafood soup.  It sounded so good.  It had all sorts of seafood.  However, the meat was too hard to get to.  It was really messy so I gave up.  I was really disappointed.  The plates, bowls, and eating utensils are all very stylish.  I really enjoy experiencing other cultures and love trying their foods.  I'm beginning to like Korean food more and even developing a taste for kimchi.  If you like Korean food then I highly recommend this place."}

I know, it's ironic to say kimchi can be fresh since it's fermented but it's crispy and just the right amount of spicy and zest. Also had to try the sundubu and can honestly say the flavors were there. I usually go to Tofu Hut but now have a new go to place for tofu soup. The tofu was sooooo smooth it literally melted in my mouth and usually sundubu can be watered down because of the soft tofu disintegrates, but despite the softness, the tofu kept its shape and did not dilute the soup. Been wanting to come to this place for a year now and now kick myself for taking so long to actually make it. Service was also very gracious, as they took back a dish we thought was something else without a grumble.  It started getting busy and the gal handled almost all the tables. The guy could have been better, but more for her sake than ours as we were already almost done with our late dinner!"}

This is the first Asian restaurant I go to where the servers treated EVERYONE equally regardless of gender and nationality..

Has the nice cafe feel of one you would find in Korea. Their menu is pretty simple compared to the majority of Korean restaurants around town, but they add a tapas twist to their menu which makes it unique. Their dishes are delicious but unique, so don't expect the typical Korean barbeque when you go here, but something different. It sounds simple, but try their cheesy corn, one of my favorites.

Just to give it another shot, I went with a friend again and a person who has never tried Korean food.  Other than the ok galbi, both of us thought every other dish was insipid, overcooked, and just gross.

The portions were decent, it would fill up two to three people easily, and the stew was perfectly spicy (note: I have a high tolerance for spiciness) and had so many ingredients that it was enjoyable to eat. Next we got the Blood Sausage Stir Fry which was hearty and savory with a slight kick... Yum!  Overall it was a good experience, and my family was definitely satisfied.

A small place in a strip mall full of Koreans, young and old eating masses of food. Twinkly lights and a hippyish vibe.  Great. friendly service, we had pork belly, blood sausage, pancake, bulgogi, big portions that lasted a couple of days.  This blood sausage was the best I have had in a long time.  Washed it down with a bottle of lychee martini - yes a bottle - see picture and barley tea in little metal cups.

She got chicken in lettuce and it was a little bland but I added some of the red chili paste and it was great.  They served us chips and salsa and the salsa was pretty good too.  The chips were crispy and soggy at the same time.  Some people like this, I don't really as they are chewy.  The fried wontons were good also, but not as good as being in Korea and getting yakimando.  The bulgogi was HUGE and AWESOME.  The total bill was 20 bucks and we took more than 1/2 home.  I asked Linda if the wonton was like yaki and she picked up that I had been to Korea before and offered some kimchi.  She said it's not on the menu but it is there if you want it.

Did the bulgogi fusion burrito, the first bite was so out there it was ridiculously good, never tasted anything like it ever, each bite got even better than the last until it was all gone. The owner, Linda I believe, hooked it up, with some pretty good egg rolls, with salsa and guacamole , tortilla chips, oranges for dessert nicely presented, and bottled water. The egg rolls aren't a regular item and need to be ordered in advance. Everything is made fresh so your food gets to you a little longer but well worth the wait.

I typically don't travel this far for tacos but, the fusion of Korean, Mexican, American, and Chinese... come on you gotta try it.  The owners of the small restaurant are husband and wife.  The wife was super nice and was always attentive and shared stories of how they started the business.  And, the husband does all the cooking.  Anyhow, business was good and people that were in and out were on a first name basis with the owners (that's always a plus).  We started our meal with chips with salsa and guacamole.  With the chips we were also given Chinese Zodiac place mats....only at KoMex (gotta love the quirks).  Skimming the menu I started with a craving for the fusion tacos (Korean/Mexican) but, then I wanted a plate of noodles...LOL when does that ever happen if you're not at a buffet.  We ended up getting 5 Bul-gogi (Beef) tacos and a rice plate with Daeji-gogi (pork).  We were going to order more but the owner recommended that we didn't even though she could of just let us order.  And she was right, the quantity was more than enough!  On to the quality...the Bul-gogi tacos were filled with green and brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, lettuce and your choice of sauce.  They brought a smile to my face.  Also, the Daeji-gogi was so delicious!  For me I have to have KimChi on the side as a pickled garnish.  Anyhow, after finishing our delicious Korean/Mexican meal we ended our visit with a sliced orange and fortune cookies for desert.  The only thing that I had an issue with was the location.  I just wish this place was a little closer and they would definitely have a regular customer.  My brother is coming to town at the end of the month and I love trying to impress him with food spots they don't have back in Chicago.  This is one of the hole in the wall places that will definitely make an awesome impression on his taste buds."}

My first reaction when I saw this place on Yelp was (1) what a crappy part of town; and (2) NO REALLY what a crappy part of town this can't possibly be that good.  I was wrong.  Even when you first walk into the restaurant the building and decorations look like some budget Chinese place that chops up cats in the back alley.

There was one asian woman running all the tables, and she did a great job considering the steady stream of customers.  We ordered the pork and beef taco for about $1 each.  Incredible how much they gave you for that amount of money.  I was pretty sated with my two tacos, but I whipped my wimpy appetite into submission and downed half a chicken burrito and 1/3 of the kim chi fried rice rec'd by all you Yelpers.  They were both good, and even tastier with the hot sauce (salsa?  kim chi?  kim chi salsa??).  (There were 3 sauces on the condiment basket...I think the other were regular asian chili sauce and something with a hint of sweetness...iunno.  the salsa was my favorite).

Well the answer is, the food is REALLY that good and now they have a NEW friend  (89th) to put down a great review for them. I don't think I can add anything to the reviews that hasn't already been said regarding how GREAT the food is so I wont bother to reiterate. But I will say this....I DON'T KNOW how these people make any money! The FOOD is SO good, and the portions are SO HUGE and the PRICES are SO CHEAP, I just could not compute how they do it. I even hinted  that the GIGANTIC 4.99 burrito that was STUFFED with tons of meat would cost at LEAST 8 or 9 dollars where I'm from. Hell a Chipotle burrito with sour cream and guacamole is around 8 bucks and the food here is MUCH more worth the money and MUCH more flavorful. I would go here over Chipotle any day!

Each was very good to excellent, though next time I would skip the beef in flavor (sic) of the pork or chicken"}

{"business_id": "H_SuH7uLiYahDMbNBB9kog", "text": "You want a fusion of Korean and Mexican food at an outrageously reasonable (almost feel guilty it's so inexpensive) price?  Komex is the place!  When you are seated, they give you chips and salsa/guacamole.  You can tell the chips are homemade, and not store bought.  I ordered the Bulgogi Burrito and Fusion taco with green tea.  The taco was very tasty.  The meat is sweet and combined well with the coolness of the slaw.  They have their own Kimchee salsa that goes very well with it.  The Burrito was Huge.  I always finish my food, but I could only eat 1/2 the burrito.  Again, the meat was sweet and mixed well with the spanish rice and Kimchee salsa.  The entire bill was only $8.50!  The burrito was under $5, the taco was $1.35 (or something like that).  Well worth the price and well worth the trip.  The owner was extremely nice and the service was great.  Try it if you are in that part of town."}

My friend and I also shared the beef fries...comparable to carne asada fries, but with Korean beef. This place is amazing. The service was a bit slow which is why it gets 4 starts instead of 5.

Second I brought my girl up there cause the food was so good and we had to wait 40 min just to get the food and the order was wrong and she didn't want to wait for it to be corrected. Very frustrating but both times what I ate was so so good."}

A ton of delicious food (this ended up being lunch AND dinner for two people) for very little money. I even loved the hot sauce, and normally I can't take anything too spicy. A little bit of their regular hot sauce on my food was perfect. However, they said they can make the food much spicier if you ask - so it's a great place for spice-wimps like me, and spice-hounds like my boyfriend (who will pretty much eat ghost peppers and not die). Very friendly staff/owners as well. Highly recommend."}

In the end, taxi never showed and the owner Linda graciously offered us a ride back to our hotel.  I've never rated on yelp before and this may just be the beginning of more to come.

We were able to snag a small table by the door and it took a little while for them to come take our order.  We ordered the Bulgogi Nacho's, which were absolutely amazing.  They were so flavorful and we were able to demolish the whole plate quickly.  I liked their homemade chips and guacamole as well.  Next came out our Daejiogoi Burrito with fried Kimchi, which we ended up taking to go since we were so full from the chips (burrito was good, but I will try it with bulgogi next time and without salsa).  I was also pleased with the egg Musubi and chicken taco.  The price and flavors cannot be beat!  I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}

I fantasize about the fusion burrito with kimchi whenever I'm eating anything that isn't a fusion burrito with kimchi. Also the food quantity to cost ratio and flavor to cost ratio is more mind blowing than quantum mechanics. I just can't get my mind around it. But it doesn't matter, because every time I wrap my lips around a fusion burrito my mind instantly drifts away from rationality and enters an altered state of consciousness that consists of unadulterated bliss and euphoria. It's a profoundly addictive experience."}

They have a Korean spicy sauce that is to die for! Not spicy! Just perfect. The only complaint would be the service. For a first timer it is a little confusing because you really don't know if you need to seat yourself or if there is a waitress. Well, we just sat down ourselves and a waitress did show up.

Because I was traveling, sharing and heard it was cheap. My favorite was the burrito, then the nachos. It was all good but I didn't care for the noodles (just me).

My spicy Korean pork burrito was gigantic and filled to the brim with delicious tender pork, fresh pico de gallo, flavorful Mexican rice, onions, kimchi, and lettuce.

KoMex is quite a ways from my house but their food's so good I don't mind driving half way across town for it. The restaurant is a little small and the decor is just regular, but that's not important. The food is what's important. They offer chips with salsa and FRESH guacamole to snack on while you wait for your order. I'm a big fan of carne asada fries so when I tried their bulgogi fries it was just heaven on earth. It is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. The bulgogi burrito is also very good but I rather prefer their fries.

I took them back up to the owner and she apologized and offered to bring me another basket. At that point I just paid the bill and left. I really loved Komex as you can tell from my previous reviews.

The waiter brought out complimentary homemade chips with guac and salsa dip to start our night out.  We ordered the bulgogi burrito and kimchi fried rice and our friends had their fusion tacos.  Both dishes were quite good and fulfilling.  The portion size is huge and the ingredients inside were very fresh.  Although the bulgogi could have been more flavourful, their special house sauce and other hot sauce condiments really made the burrito stand out.  I really enjoyed this fusion restaurant, but because it is so far away from me, I think I will only be coming here if I am in the neighborhood for some other reason.

After seeing pictures of those fries and living in San Diego for years where carne asada fries are like crack, I couldn't resist.  Everything was delicious!  The tacos were cheap and had great flavor.  We ordered kimchi on the side which was a nice accompaniment.  The burrito used similar ingredients but could definitely fill you for days.  The fries came out on a huge plate and we could barely make a dent in them, although we did try our best.  The server was very attentive and friendly.

I fed a table of three for just about $20 and the great thing about it was we were all full to our bellies!   The fusion of korean and mexican food is done right at KoMex.  Korean BBQ, salsa and corn tortillas make a good combo especially at the going rate of $1+ each.  Throw it down with the killer Bulgogi Fries, which is a mother-load of marinated bbq, salsa and cheese on top of a bed of fries.  Be sure to try out all the sauces on their sauce caddy.  The mix of korean and mexican salsa makes a great addition to such classy grub! Kimchi I'm out!  ...oh but don't forget, location is a lil' north townish, so lock yo doors!"}

I ran out of cheese once....at 10:30pm....on our busiest night....ever. No beef, so I ordered the Bulgogi pork belly taco which was very tasty and fresh. Additionally, I ordered the Fusion Quesadilla w/chicken as recommended by the server. It was good but nothing real special. I think I need to go back when they have some beef, otherwise I have a hard time understanding the lofty rankings. Additionally, while the price was right the service was a bit clipped, even for a busy lunch and the buser refilling the drinks and setting the tables really didn't seem like he wanted to be there. To be clear, this would be a great spot to have in ones neighborhood, but if it's in your neighborhood, you don't need Yelp to find it. So if you're at the Cosmopolitan and thinking about getting your car out of valet or grabbing a cab up to Komex....think twice."}

My boyfriend ordered the bulgogi fusion burrito which was okay tasting too but was still missing something. My sister orders the bulgogi plate which was just bland. It was just bulgogi & rice which I could have made at home. I asked for a side of kimchi & the portion was so small. It was literally a spoon full of Kim chi which also didnt taste very good. Besides the food tasting just okay the customer service was not great. Idk if it was because they were busy or what but when I called to order for pick up the guy on the phone seemed irritated & was rushing me. Whatever the deal is & even if its busy your customer service should always be on point. Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying."}

I had ordered the bulgogi rolls, usually 6 per order, kenny had never heard of them and had to ask the kitchen about them.  When I checked the order at home there were only 4 rolls and I had made a double order.  When I called Kenny got an attitude with me stating they don't really make them anymore and they won't again because you have franchised out.

I had to try this - first - it's in a really iffy part of town, so for me lunch was the only time I'd go here.  Tried the fried rice, bul go gi sliders, and a bul go gi burrito. For me the attempt at fusing Mexican and Korean was not a successful one. The flavour was okay but not nearly as spectacular as my buddy thought it was.  Unfortunately,  I didn't see the appeal of mixing the two types of foods together - at least on the dishes we had.

I ordered 2 Komex tacos with tofu, and a side order of Kimchee fried rice. My husband ordered the Bulgogi burrito and he absolutely loved it. My daughter had a spam musubi and son ordered the cheeseburger with fries. I was also happy that they had stevia and sugar in the raw as an option for my tea. My food was delicious but I would recommend done thing. To maybe marinate and fry the tofu so it has a crispier texture when placed in the tacos. Over-all, great experience."}

For me fusion is Kogi, because it's literally two different types of food coming together: synergy. This place is more like segregation, the food just doesn't mix well. It's quite literally Mexican food and Korean food, served like a layer cake, none of it is combined in any culinary way. The burrito I got was dry, it was just bulgogi and lettuce in a wrapped, me choking with every bite on the way down. I won't continue, it just didn't do the job of fusing.

I don't even know how this is possible when spicy pork (mewoon daeji bulgogi) is anything but bland and it's the filling.  I got corn tacos with kalbi and spicy pork, they were okay.

We have eaten Pho all across the valley so you can be sure that when we say these guys Pho is straight Bommi Mommi, we mean that. If you think Pho Kim Long or Pho so 1 is good Pho, then you better get to this joint and see what truly legit pho tastes like. This is our 5th time here in the past couple weeks and each time its as good or better than the last.The broth is clear, flavorful, fragrant and sublime. Something that other pho joints are slipping on these days. the bbq pork banh mi is the best we had in vegas so far, the pork so juicy, the veg pickled just right and the bread the right combo of chewy and flakey.

The broth does have more star anise and beefy flavor and I guess you can say it's a tiny bit than their Pho competitors in Vegas. However, the overall rating of the Pho Bowl is just average. I'm not sure if I'm just used to the portion in Vegas, but I would like to see a little more meat in the bowl. The rice dish is alright, below average in my opinion. Other noodle dish is average also. I would like them to sweep the floor a little more frequent, since nasty food bit on the floor kinda make the place look less appetizing.

We used yelp to help us find and decide where to eat and given that this place had a 4 star avg. with 80 reviews, nothing could go wrong, right? Wrong. At least for me it did. All my friends wanted pho but I wanted something different and back at home, I love the broken rice and pork chops or whatever. I saw that they had a Filet Mignon option and opted for that instead of pho. Big mistake. The food came out rather quickly and I dug right in. Expecting to taste filet mignon, I tasted beef steak cubes. Nothing CLOSE to the advertised 'filet mignon' but this was probably my fault for ordering 'filet mignon' at a pho place. Also, 4 of my 5 friends ordered the thai tea and they all hated it. I LOVE my thai iced tea so I had to try to see what the fuss was all about. And right they were, the thai tea was gross. It tasted like thai powdered water with a bad after taste. My friends did enjoy the pho though, I just don't recommend getting the 'filet mignon.' They vegetarians rolls are good as well."}

Instead we were all disappointed (5 of us) by the food and quality of service!! We hit up Kinh Do because it had an average of 4 stars, instead it was by far one of my worst experiences at an Asian Restaurant. 1. We hit up the spot around noonish on Christmas Eve and it was pretty crowded so we waited patiently, however, rather than clearing the table directly in front of us that could fit our party of five, they continue to fill all open clean tables before finally getting to us. After waiting 15 minutes for a table, we had to wait another 15 minutes just to order drinks! There was plenty of time to looked through the menu 2-3x so we ordered during the same time as our drinks. The waiters were dressed in regular chill clothing, which made it difficult for us to wave down a server because they got our drink orders wrong! We ordered Vietnamese coffee, hot tea, waters, and a thai tea. They forgot the Vietnamese coffee and only gave water to those who did not order a drink. That took at least 10 minutes. After they finally brought out the drinks, they asked us again what we ordered. Apparently the server who took our order forgot (he didn't write it down). We ordered two pho dac biets, a beef stew, spicy chicken noodle soup because they didnt have the chicken curry I wanted, and a bun ba hue. My spicy chicken noodle soup was meh. The noodles were OVER cooked and started to absorb too much of the liquid and become mushy. Everyone else said their dish was alright. The thing that sucked was, my brother didnt get his bun ba hue until all of us were about 75% done with our dishes. They never came back to check up on us, and when asked for the bill, they told us to go to the counter to get it. Never hittin up this spot again."}

The bahn mi was pretty tasty as well. In addition to having the nice crunch in the bread and the daikon radish was good too.

When we got there, it wasn't crowded so we were seated immediately (next to a fan too = a plus since it's summer right now).  I was a little skeptical with the pho that I ordered but at that point, I had no choice.  I just needed to inject some of that pho broth in my vein to feel alive again.  To my surprise, pho at this place wasn't so bad....in fact, it was GOOD! I literally devoured my bowl in no time.  The broth wasn't watered down like at some places I went to nor was the noodles too hard or too mushy.  The temperature of the broth was perfect  ( I like my pho to be hot and not just luke warm).  For sure, the next time I find myself in Vegas again, I will definitely stop by to get my pho-craving fulfill."}

The Pho is known for their broth. It was like eating instant pho noodle. The key flavors is the richness of the beef broth and the star anise. I could hardly taste both ingredients. And for the egg rolls. It was okay but the dipping fish sauce was gross! All I could taste was vinegar and water down fish sauce. It wasn't sweet enough and not very authentic to Vietnamese cooking. I have my fair share of pho restaurants through out California. This place by far was one of the worst food I have ever tasted. If you are going to represent vietnamese cuisine,  you have to at least stay true to it taste. Do a little more research. Eat out more and travel so you have something to compare it too.

But, unfortunately I am pretty sure they ended up charging us for it. The pho was bland and extremely forgettable. I really fail to see where these high ratings are stemming from. They skimped on everything AND the broth tasted like hot water until I added sriracha, then it tasted like sriracha water. The bathroom looked like it doubled as a broom closet.

I prefer the leafy green lettuce, but they used romaine.  My usual grilled shrimp w/grilled pork over vermicelli was ok, the pork a little overdone and chunky vs the thinner slices that are so much tender.  Our caramelized short ribs were good.  I don't recommend the clay pot caramelized fish unless you enjoy skimpy portions of fish in overcooked sugar sauce and you like spitting out the bones.

The bun bo hue with the spicy lemongrass broth was very good and I enjoyed the meat loaf that comes with it.  They also have large chunks of beef.  I just wish it came with pieces of tendon as well.

A few weeks ago told a different story. I had a craving for curry on a Monday night but Saffron is closed on Monday. I did not know this until after I tried three doors before seeing their hours posted on the first door revisited. I was frustrated. Today, though, is Wednesday and Saffron is open.  I parked at about 5:45 in an open and empty lot. As I approached, a man opened the door and warmly welcomed me in. Good impression number one. I was seated immediately as the restaurant was mostly empty much to my surprise. When I was seated I noticed the strong aroma of the many exotic spices I would be enjoying shortly. I also noticed the Indian music lending itself to a comforting and authentic dining experience. Good impression number two. Within less than a minute of being seated I was brought a glass of water, a food menu, a wine menu, a basket of crispy flat bread stuff (apologies for not knowing the true name), and two sauces. A mint sauce and a tamarind sauce. The latter of the two sauces was my favorite. I took a few minutes to familiarize myself with the menu. I settled upon Palak Chicken and a side of Garlic Naan.  The naan came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. It was hot, crisp, and chewy with plenty of minced garlic on top. A few minutes later my Palak Chicken came out in a hot bowl and accompanied with    long grain rice in a separate bowl. The Palak was a brilliant green from the spinach. It was topped with cream and a sprig of cilantro. A beautiful presentation to be sure. I had trouble finding the chicken until I spooned it on to my plate. It was there hiding out amongst the spinach base. It was not the most tender chicken I have had at an Indian restaurant but chicken does not need to be fork tender to be good. It still fell apart in my mouth. Good impression number three. I ate all of my rice but took my Palak Chicken and Garlic Naan home to have for lunch the next day. My check came as I was bagging up my leftovers. It had a smiley face drawn on it. Talk about service with a smile.  Good impression number four. This was very much a comfortable and relaxing dining experience. From the soft spoken and friendly waiter to the delicious food cooked to my spice request of 3 (out of 10), my night at Saffron was just what the doctor ordered. I will be back but probably not all too soon. It is a little  high priced as Indian cuisine tends to be. But when the hunger strikes, an occasional splurge is in well within reason."}
{"business_id": "QwrWxzfGdv_bMiFrDaV4sA", "text": "What a total disappointment!! I was naive and did not listen to some of the reviews here. The biggest complaint I have is price and quantity/quality of food. I ordered chicken tikka masala and lamb with spinach curry or something like that. First, the flavor was nothing special, I actually thought it was bland and something I could have made myself. Second, the prices are ridiculous, look I don't mind paying a lot of money if it's worth it. I've been to Gordon Ramsay on Paris and Del Friscos Double Eagle steakhouse, both expensive but totally worth it.  The prices, chicken tikka masala was $15, serve in a(I kid you not)dog's bowl size container(6 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep), 4 little cubes of chicken and the rest was sauce. The lamb, $16, same as the chicken tikka, 4-5 little pieces and the rest was sauce. I felt totally cheated. I give this business a few more months and it's going to close down. People please listen up and spend it where you can get more bang and flavor for hour buck, trust me on this one. Go to Mt Everest on Sahara or something similar but not this one please!!!"}

While I don't usually eat the garlic naan with my meals theirs is the best I've tasted.  I highly recommend you try this place."}

I spent 5 years in the UK and have dine in over 200 Indian restaurants, I'm pretty sure I know what I am talking about. Indian restaurants in Europe are more authentic I may say, so much so that at one point the UK made Chicken Tikka Masala UK's national food. $14 or $15, it was still a small amount of food for the money. Just try going to one of the known Indian restaurants around here and you know what I am talking about. Bottom line, food quality/quantity is not worth the price and I believe people need to know this before going."}

Tonight we decided to have a date night and without hesitation decided once again on Saffron. We were greeted immediately upon entering by the warmest of hosts. They weren't able to seat us right away and so invited us to have a seat in the bar while our table was being prepared. We are not all to familiar with Indian cuisine so when it came to ordering our waitress was extremely informative in guiding us though the selections. Our food came out piping hot and fresh. You could tell it was served immediately when finished cooking and had not sit in a window for at length of time. The favors and experience could not be topped in my opinion. I would recommend this exquisite place to everyone for any and all occasions. You will never be disappointed when you choose Saffron Flavors of India."}

The meats are cooked and spiced to perfection. The curry is everything you would hope and expect from good Indian cuisine.  My favorite dish that we ordered was the combination platter of meat, which included some of the better seasoned meats I've purchased in a very long time.  My only gripe is the portions in relation to the price. It is a little pricey for the small amount of food that you get.  If the portions got bigger or the price was reduced, I would be eating here very frequently.  As is, I don't feel like spending $40 on a meal for two all that often."}
{"business_id": "QwrWxzfGdv_bMiFrDaV4sA", "text": "Ok, I swear I have a serious food addiction. Its one of my favorite subjects to talk about on a daily basis. And I actually get a high from eating. But all foods are not the same. The feeling I get from one food may be far greater than that of a different food. Case in point, curry provides me with one of the strongest highs I know. But not all curries are created equal. A Thai curry is far different from the curries in an Indian restaurant. Either way curry is a comfort food to me. It is astounding how one meal can change ones mood so completely and curry fits that profile. Tonight I had a more mild curry at Saffron Flavors of India. More so I had a full experience featuring curry. I started with the complimentary papadan and two sauces of which I am not all too familiar but I am a fan of nonetheless. I also ordered a bottle of Taj Mahal pilsner style beer. For my entree I ordered butter chicken and a side of garlic naan. The naan was warm, chewey and perfect as always. It was the perfect accompaniment to the buttery rich chicken curry with a touch of tomato. The high from this meal was such that my eyes were half closed and I had a soft grin on my face during the entire meal. I was experiencing a sort of nirvana. And why stop there. I had my opener, my side, my entree and my drink all of Indian origin. It was time to round out the evening with dessert. I thought I should try the galub jaman. There were two fried dough balls served in a warm rose syrup and topped with what seemed to be dried coconut. It was very sweet but insanely delicious as everthing else I had tonight was. This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. This is the stuff dreams are made of. Maybe its just the beer talking. Nah."}

Really? Ugh, so i was on the search again, and then WALLAH!!! E-JO came into the convo from a friend, and she said her fav soup was like a MILKY based soup. Ding Ding Ding, it was right on. Seollangtang!!! This is sort of a milky bone soup that served up with slices of brisket and somen noodles. Its not salty at all, so when you get your soup, you are given salt, green onions and chili pepper paste to put in the soup yourself to control the salt and spice level. SO ONO!I But on the menu, this is the #1 dish on the Menu, Beef Brisket Soup.  This place definitely does seollangtang right, not to mention the price is reasonable.

The cooked beef soup was great, but we did order the mixed meat soup which included parts of beef I did not care for (tripe, etc. etc. etc.)   So if you are not that adventurous, just get the beef.   Also, the other Korean dishes are great.   If you go, helpful to have a Korean with you or you can ask the waiter/waitress more info.   WARNING: traditional Korean.   So do not expect the grills."}

We love any kind of Asian food and are pleased to have a new place to go close to the house. When we pulled into the parking lot there was only one car there and we were not sure they were open, even though the sign said they were. We tried the door and were greeted my David( the owner) with a warm hello. He welcomed us and told us about how he came here from Naples Florida and just opened a month ago. He assured us we would love our meal and he was right. He made a couple of suggestion and we settled on starting with the Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli. We watched Lisa, David's wife and a wonderful chef, prepare the appetizer from our table. It is nice to see an open kitchen where you can watch everything being freshly made. For dinner I had the Red Nah noodles and my wife had the Massaman Curry. Both were outstanding, although I have to take my wife's word on the curry since I don't enjoy curry. The portions were good size and we even had a little left to take home. My only trepidation about writing this review is that Pan Asian is a small restaurant with only about 14 seats and I don't want to always have to wait in line for my new favorite local place. My other recommendation to David was for him t o make sure that Lisa's name goes on the name of the place as well since her food is the real star of the show."}

Then my second visit I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special . My third visit I ordered the Massaman Curry with the Pad Thai. I've also tried their Crying Tiger but I think hands down my favorite thing on the menu is the Pad Thai ...it's addicting! The second thing on their menu I can't get enough of is their Fried Ice Cream . I prefer this over their Deep Fried Cheese Cake. The Ice Cream really looks like it's fried.....they don't cheat by putting toasted corn flakes on it either. This place is one of my favorites."}

Unfortunately the duck was off the menu that day so might be back to try that another day. I have to say price vise i have had cheaper Thai food at few other places just as good as this, but this is one of the better place.

I scored a yelp deal and got some $20 gift certificates for $10 each. The first time we went we ordered the Grilled Squid Salad, Malaysian Yellow Curry and Red Nah Noodles. All were good but the squid in the grilled squid salad was amazing! The second time we visited we order the Seafood Soup and the Crying Tiger Salad. The owner also suggested we try the Vietnamese Style Chicken Wings (which was not on the menu). Once again, the squid in the soup was excellent--very tender. Overall, I'd recommend this place to my friends if they want an alternative to Archi's, Pin Kaow or the like but within the same price range. I'd also recommend finding the Yelp deal that I did: $10 for $20 worth of food. Also, I'd like to mention that the Owners are very friendly and remembered us from a month ago when we first visited."}

{"business_id": "8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg", "text": "Eating here was a good experience.  I bought the Yelp Deal: $20 for $10.  I've decided that Groupon mostly sends you to places that are having troubles for a reason.  That is, I'm usually disappointed with the Groupon experiences.  Yelp Deals, on the other hand, have turned out pretty good so far.  This place is a little far from home.  Usually, if I drive this far then I just go on down to Chinatown.  Parking was ok.  Upon entering I turned to my girlfriend and commented about how this was probably going to be a bad experience because the place was totally empty.  It was around 6:45 pm on Tuesday.  But, we settled in determined to give it a fair try.  I began noticing all of the nice things about the place.  It was nicely decorated.  I assume the owner did the decorating.  I describe it as contemporary Asian.  It was not high end Vegas strip decorating style, but more like well put together do it yourself style.  The kitchen was in full view of the dining area.  I always like that.  I cringe to think what goes on out of sight.  So many restaurant shows today let us normal people peek behind the curtain and witness the often disgusting truth.  Also, I was delighted to see Asian people making Asian food.  At least makes me believe I'm in for authentic flavors.  Modern music played lightly over the audio system.  It was pleasant.  I assume the man waiting on us was the owner, David Wong.  He was very friendly and attentive.  He did a really good job.  He tried very hard to give us a great experience.  Every item on the menu was under $11.  That's pretty good.  I like good food, but I enjoy it even better when I feel like I'm getting a good deal.  The menu had a variety of Asian dishes, as the name implies: Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese, etc.  We ordered two dishes.  The first was Filet Mignon Pho.  It was a Thai version of Vietnamese Pho.  My Thai girlfriend explained that the abundance of roasted garlic was a signature difference.  The sauces were all added before serving.  The veggies were slightly different (can't explain) and the meat was filet mignon (Wow! Step It Up!).  The noodles were cooked just right.  I enjoyed the Pho, but there are way better places to get Pho in this town.  The second dish was Basil Sauace Stir Fry.  It had chicken, sweet basil, garlic, chili tomatoes, and long beans served with rice.  Spiciness was 8 out of 10.  It was really tasty.  I specifically enjoyed the fresh veggies.  My only complaint was that the dish had too much oil.  I realized just how much after we finished the dish and were left staring at the puddle before us.  It made me feel a little bad about something I had just enjoyed.  We were pretty much full, but wanted to spend at least $20 for the Yelp deal so we ordered another entree.  We had asked the server earlier what their signature dish was.  He recommended the Pad-See-Yaw.  So, that's what we ordered.  It was pan-fried flat noodles with pork, broccoli, black soy beans, and egg.  My girlfriend explained that this dish is commonly ordered by Caucasians at Thai restaurants.  She was surprised that I had never heard of it (we usually eat Thai food at her house, not restaurants).  It was very sweet.  My girlfriend and the server had a quick conversation in Thai.  He asked if we wanted a dessert.  We said no, but I thought the sweet Pad-See-Yaw was dessert.  After he left, my girlfriend explained that she told him it was too sweet and he replied that its how Americans like it.  I thought that was funny.  We were already full when the third dish came out so we tasted it and put it in a to go box.  The server came by and chatted with us for a while.  He explained that he had been open for about nine months.  Before that he had a successful high end Asian restaurant in Florida.  Articles hung on the wall behind us explaining it.  By the time we left it had become pretty busy.  The place had four or five more couples and a few take out customers came through.  Overall, it was a good experience.  The server was attentive and the food came out fast.  The menu was very affordable.  The decorations were interesting and inviting.  I really wanted to give it five starts, but  the food was good, not great.  Its worth a try."}

This is the case with Pan Asian.  It's been one of my bookmarked places for quite a while and I finally got to experience it for myself last night.  Arriving there around 7:30pm and armed with the Yelp deal, my boyfriend and I were the third party seated in the restaurant.  As other reviews have already stated, Pan Asian is run by a husband and wife team and that's it!  He's the host and waiter and she's the chef.  I already knew that we had to try the tiger mango shrimp salad and the Thai Linguine because I trust most Yelpers and those dishes were highly recommended.  Let me tell you, I felt like we hit the jackpot again!  If I could have that salad every day, I would!  It had real greens, not the wanna-be iceberg lettuce.  The mango and grilled shrimp combined to make it one of the best salads I've had, light and savory.  We ordered the Thai Linguine with shrimp and not spicy AT ALL, because I'm wimpy that way.  This dish, too, was great.  I'm usually boring and order Pad Thai when I have Thai food, but not when I return here, and, yes, I will definitely be back!  It's the kind of place that you want to return to again and again to see how everything else on the menu tastes.  I just hope that not everyone crowds over there all at once; Lisa is, after all, a one-woman show in the kitchen!  Enjoy!"}

The food was SO DELICIOUS that we actually went back there the next night bringing the rest of the crew JUST so they can try the CRYING TIGER SALAD! Me & my family have now found a new fave place to eat! We ordered various items on the menu, and they were all good, food was freshly made and NO MSG! I am just going to give you a run down of MAI FAVES though, so here goes, definitely try the Roti, it comes with a  lightly sweet Malaysian yellow curry dipping sauce, the curries were really good too, we tried the massaman, & the panang, & the Pad See Ew was so flavorful , we tried the shrimp tiger salad with mangoes, that was delicious as well, but I have to say that the STAR of the dinner table was the Crying Tiger Salad, the steak was cooked just right, it melted in your mouth, you can tell it's char broiled, the dressing was phenomenal! I have to warn you though,they don't call it Crying Tiger for nothing, be careful when ordering your spice # coz the spiciness will make a tiger cry! I had # 3 and it was SPICY but good! My crazy husband dared to get # 4! Most of their menu items are spicy, so if you are not into spicy food your choices will be limited, but the owners and chef are VERY accommodating and will try to cater to your specific needs. Oh, and yes dessert, we definitely had room for dessert. We tried the fried ice cream as well as the fried cheesecake, I definitely like the fried cheese cake better, although we did clean both plates, Hungry much? We are definitely coming back to this place, it is pretty small, but I like to call it cozy, oh & YES they speak very fluent English! You can see the chef, who is David Wong's wife, lovingly preparing the meal you are about to chow down. You can clearly tell that she puts her heart & soul into her cooking, even though this is a small mom & pop restaurant all the dishes are presented like a work of art. They take pride in their product that is why they give it their best. So if you are having second thoughts, banish those fears from your brain, try this place out and you will discover a gem in the middle of Sahara."}

It is a 25 minute drive from where I live to the restaurant, I have to drive through Chinatown to get there.  Its worth the drive.   David and Lisa are husband and wife and the owners of the place.  The kitchen is open so you can see exactly what is going on.  It is very clean.  They will make you feel like family.  David makes it a point to know everyone by name and the next time you come in he will ask about the people that were there last time.  The food is top notch I have eaten at several Thai restaurants including one in town that is a favorite on the food network channel, there is nothing that is close to the quality of food that Chef Lisa prepares.  She will vary the heat according to your taste.  I like an 8 on most things, in the soup it is a slow heat that builds.  She uses fresh Thai peppers and they do not release their heat immediately, so be careful.  I normally order one of the soups to start an entree and then dessert.  The Fishball and Beef Noodle Soups are both excellent.  They are always asking us to try something new, that isn't on the menu.  The Red and Duck Curries are incredible.  Each of the ingredients maintains its individual flavor and yet they all work together.  Sometimes they have a Key Lime Pie in a small cup it is yummy.  Maybe if I mention it enough people will ask for it and they will have it all of the time.  It is the perfect compliment to the spicy food.  The Sticky Rice with Mango and sesame seeds is very nice.  There is a little bit of sea salt that accents the warm sticky rice and the ice cold mango with coconut milk. If I find something that I don't like I will let you know but so far everything that I have tried I would eat again.  it is getting tougher to get through the menu as I go back to what I have eaten before."}

Very spicy so you may want to go down a number or two from your normal preference.  Great service, food, and prices. Just check your bag, they have forgotten my rice a few times when I have larger orders :)"}
{"business_id": "8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg", "text": "The food was just excellent. First the roti appetizer was excellent, basically fried bread with curry sauce. The chicken satay was also very good, meat was moist and had the best peanut sauce I've tasted so far. Most peanut sauce  I have tasted is usually overpowering with flavor, this sauce was just well blended and flavorful. The Crying Tiger salad was different in a good way, spicy and the dressing had just the right amount of sourness. The Duck curry of course was  our favorite. The meat perfectly moist inside and just crisped right outside. The curry was just a perfect balance with the duck and brought out the flavor from the meat, plus I never thought the grapes in the dish would work but it did. Lastly the fried ice cream was the perfect ending to a wonderful dinner. Lisa the cook is absolutely amazing. Doreen our server was very friendly and informative about our menu selections. David the owner was funny also and kind of kept the place together. The atmosphere was very friendly and casual. Everybody in Las Vegas and out of towners should try this place"}

And especially glad to have a great Thai restaurant nearby.  The food is soooooo fresh and hot when it gets to the table, the flavors are fabulous, and David gives wonderful service.  I love the soups and every dish I've tried.  My favorite is the pad thai (with tofu).  Best pad thai I have had.  I will still go to Panna Thai once in a while because I like that style of Tom Yum soup, but I will be going here more often for everything else.  I haven't had room for dessert yet, but hopefully next time I'll have room for the tempura cheesecake.  My friends that I've gone with really enjoyed this place, as well, and they will be switching from their old go-to Thai places to this one."}
{"business_id": "8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg", "text": "They changed their lunch specials a bit... prices are still the same but they stopped including a soda.  Also, the last two times I got the red curry it was about one half or 2/3 the normal portion size... nowhere near enough to cover the rice.  I recently tried Prommare's and introduced my coworkers to it.  We get Thai at work at least once a week and were always loyal Pan Asian customers, but with our last two visits leaving something to be desired, I don't know that we'll return.  I still enjoy the food but it's a competitive market and I think Prommare's is worth the extra 10-15 minutes of travel time."}

I tried pad see ew for the first time here and I am in love with it. The flavors are so developed and every bite tasted better than the one before. When it comes to spice level beware.

I like spicy and ordered a 6, after the owner warned an 8 was too hot. They don't mess around with spice here. I like that. Flat noodles, tossed with a perfect blend of seasoning, tomatoes and green beans. My husband must try the sweet and sour chicken at every new place we try. This version was a bit lighter than the usual, no thick breading, just chicken stir fried with pineapple, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes and cucumber.

It was on a weekend, so I did not see the super awesome lunch special deals that some raved about. I ordered my go to dish that allows me to best gauge a new place - drunken noodles with chicken. These were probably the best drunken noodles I've had out of countless places that I have already tried. The price was around $11 and we also shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious at the time, but pretty forgettable. I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average).

I don't think they had any prepared and threw it together because the ingredients were under cooked. We ordered Basil Sauce stir fry with shrimp, Pad Si Ew and Pad Thai. The Pad Si Ew was the best dish, well flavored.  The vegetables in the stir fry were not great and neither was the shrimp, green beans were tough and under cooked.  The Pad Thai tasted like they used sweet and sour sauce over noodles and the noodles were over cooked.  Pretty disappointing.  I will go back to Archi's for Thai."}

Well, he started talking to the cook and she got mad, said she didnt put fish sauce in it and that something is wrong with me because they make it the same way everytime. Ok. Then Mr Wong, takes it in the back and tastes it and proceeds to tell me that it must be me because it tastes fine and that maybe it was just too spicy for me. I have eaten the pad thai here over a dozen times now - I order it the same exact way everytime. So much for awesome customer service... I wont be back."}

The service is phenomenal and the owner is almost always in the restaurant and knows many of his customers by face, if not name. Be ware though, when they say spicy..they mean SPICY! A spicy level 2 there is comparable to a 5 at other Asian places..so a 10 is hot hot hot! Definitely my favorite Thai restaurant by far!"}

We shared the still fabulously refreshing tiger shrimp mango salad and I had the chicken panang lunch.  My only gripe is that brown rice is $2.50; really?  I am not willing to pay that much.

I had a truly outstanding Masaman curry, and there was a great mix of casual and fine dining atmospheres.

It tastes like a spicy seafood egg custard. Pad see-yew  which is a pan fried noodles with Chinese broccoli, black soy beans and  egg is just okay.  Pork red curry with pumpkin eggplant bell peppers coconut milk is too sweet for my taste. I want my curry spicier. They have daily specials and I chose the Pan seared salmon with mango sauce, greens, cashews--- it's very refreshing but a bit salty from the fish sauce. They have better thai iced tea compared to other places. Fast efficient service. The owner himself went to our table and explained their menu which I think is a nice touch. Will definitely come back.

Lastly we had Fried Banana w/ Ice Cream, and I didn't like it because there was coconut flakes in it and they use plantains and so it wasn't very tasty, I like it sweeter.

I passed by this joint a number of times, but never stopped in. Was feeling under the weather and thought what better than a delicious hot bowl of pho to give me some relief. I went in about 45 minutes prior to closing, and it was empty with the exception of a group of four people sitting down to eat. I was greeted by a very nice gentleman who I presume was the owner. We spoke briefly after I ordered my pho to go about the spice and how much I enjoyed spicy foods, the spicier the better for me. The restaurant was very clean. He gave me extra jalape\u00f1os and some of his extra spicy sauce. When I got home I couldn't wait to delve into my delicious pho, but immediately noticed that it had a different smell than I'm used to. It was a bit pungent to be honest. Whatever, I still wanted to give it a shot, so I put my fixings in and.......ugh it simply was not good. The broth had a sort of sweet taste to it, and just didn't mix well with the fixings. I added sprouts, jalape\u00f1o, onion, some lime, and some spicy sauce. Not even the sauce could take away that bitter sweetness. Needless to say this wont be my spot for pho. The three stars are for the cleanliness of the restaurant, the super nice owner/gentleman, and the simple fact that I only tried the pho, nothing else. I may go back to try another dish just based on the customer service."}

He taught us how to eat the egg rolls, even though I took a guess and wound up doing it right, I certainly appreciated the tutorial. I know he want to just wrap it up for me, but that would have been a bit awkward. Helpful, none the less. We ordered the egg rolls and fried wontons. We got egg roles and fried chicken wings. I know they sound the same. Fried. Oh well, we decided to keep them and they were good. I'd suggest, if this sort of thing would bother you, to speak clearly and point at what you want on the menu. We just rolled with it. I love that Viet is close to home. We also got there just before dinner rush, another plus. The portions (I noticed food is mostly served in bowls) are generous. For me, enough for leftovers. DING! Another plus. My shrimp and crab meat udan was amazing. I think I heard some angels sing. The flavor is so delicious. A new fav to add to my list and I know that this place will come in handy if I ever have a cold, that's for sure. I vow to eat pho, the next visit. Oh, and the gentlemen also gave us a little lesson on kimchi, because I asked if it asked Vietnamese which it isn't.  It's Korean, and I knew that, so I had a derp moment quickly followed up by getting my lesson and partial recovery from said derp moment. Anyhoo, I adore soup, and this is now my noodle soup heaven. Thank you, Viet Bistro, I shall return. Oh, yeah!I forgot to mention that they serve sandwiches!!! #houseofyum"}

There were a lot of reviews saying that the food was good. We were there at 10:30am and no one else was there. The men just started setting up everything when we sat down and they open at 10am. I noticed a distinct smell but I brushed it off thinking its just because my stuffy nose. I used their restroom to wash my hands. The trash was full. That means they never disposed it from the night before. Just outside the restroom were empty boxes. I peeked through one of them and it was dirty. When I passed by the door to the kitchen, I saw that everything was not organized and looked like someone left in a hurry the night before. When I got to the table, my husband tells me that the water tasted weird and the cups were dirty. He said the place is dirty and I agreed. I thought to myself if the place is dirty, I don't know about the food. I brushed it off my head telling myself the food must be bomb. They brought out the deep fried tofu first which we really liked. The pho that we ordered was just average. The shaking beef  looked black like burnt. It tasted fine but not something I'd recommend. An hour later me and my husband got an upset tummy. I wouldn't recommend this place after that."}

This is the closet real Vietnamese restaurant that I could find...and it exceeded my expectations.  I was feeling adventurous so I decided to try something different...I always see my parents order the bun bo hue when I am in Seattle, but I've always been afraid because of the congealed pork blood that normally accompanies that dish.  I'm an ABC...so certain things still scare me even though I'm asian..ha.   I noticed they had bun bo hue on the menu BUT without the congealed pork blood and the pork hock was optional.  The lemongrass beef broth was warm, spicy, savory goodness.  The beef, beef tendon, and pork hock with wide rice noodles was the perfect rainy day weather meal.  The broth wasn't quite as spicy as I would like, but the owner came by and dropped off extra spicy sauce.  I think they tame the flavors down due to their clientele and have the optional pork hock as not to scare people.  My fiance tried the chicken vermicelli bowl.  The noodles were cooked well and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  This will be my go to Viet spot if I'm too lazy to drive to Chinatown!"}

The broth tasted so flavorful and the smell was so rich in fragrant.  The delicacy of the fresh Thai basil, lemon, bean sprouts and slices of jalapenos peppers added to the  Pho danced my mouth. The slow cooking meat was very tender and for an extra $2.75 you can add a great assortment of vegetables (not cabbage). The service is fast but count on the server speaking English.

What came to my table was a large bowl of broth with only a few strands of noodles in it and three paper thin slices of beef.  The beef was so thin that I couldn't even tell what they tasted like.  I should have taken a picture of my bowl, definitely not like the pictures that have been posted.  Did they run out of noodles today?  What a total rip off for $7.50 plus tips.  Definitely not the place to go if you are hungry. The flavour of the broth was okay, but not worth the drive if you live far away.  I gave them one star because the service was okay."}

I decided to get my wonton noodle soup which was also available on their lunch specials for $6.95. There were a lot of reviews raving about their dumplings as well so we had to order some beef and onion pan fried dumplings. Everything came out shortly except the dumplings since they took a bit longer. I really enjoyed our meal especially the wonton noodle soup. They used a slightly thicker noodle than I'm used to but it was still delicious. I'm sure they can substitute for different noodles if asked.

I ordered the sliced pork and mushroom noodles and it was to die for! Not your AMERICANIZED CHINESE FOOD!!! The noodles were very tasty, soft and just the perfect consistency. The combination of flavors with the 3 kinds of mushrooms and sliced pork along with the sauce, was amazing! It's a huge portion (well at least for me) but it was so good i was able to finish 3/4 of it and you won't be able to stop eating.

Great Bao is hidden in a salon and would've never knew it if my friend hadn't directed me in the right direction.  But, alas, we found it.  Jenny and Chef Sheridan was very nice and greeted us immediately.  Jenny gave us a few suggestions off of the menu and we got to ordering.  I opted for the tofu & mushroom bao but they ran out of tofu!!  So, I prompty opted for a mushroom only version and also ordered a tofu-less tofu & mushroom salad to grub on as well.  They have a variety of drinks (including smoothies) but I opted for some hot jasmine green tea.  Jenny asked me for the names of the peeps in our group and she went on to write alliterative adjectives (how's that awesome alliteration for ya) in front of our names.  I believe mine was 'Brotherly Bronsen'.  I have a brother and my name is Bronsen.  Spot on, Jenny!  Haha anyway, they cooked up the bao for me and my group and it was grubbin'.  Annnddd if you check in on any social site (yes, including yelp), they give you a free bag of chips.  Not bad.  Good food, great service, and awesome convos.. definitely will be back.

The prices are reasonable for what you get.  The food is excellent and the ingredients are fresh and flavorful.  I get the combo platter due to the value (choice of 3 bao and a drink), and the option to mix and match bao.  I have tried the pork belly, duck, chicken, and pulled pork bao.  I am not going to get technical with all the ingredients and flavors in the bao, but let us just say that I have nothing bad to say about them.  I cannot pick a favorite because they are equally great.  When the Great Bao food truck opens, I will be sure to follow it.

Food is good, the 3 bao special is excellent taste-wise, but in my opinion it's a tad pricey and doesn't really fill you, and the Italian soda they pushed wasn't all that great. I give it 3 stars for now, but I heard they have a food truck...I'll wait to see how that is! So taste-wise I give it 5 stars, but atmosphere I give it 2."}

I like hot dogs too, so it was an easy decision to try this place out. I went with a coworker who expressed his doubts about the place yet reluctantly accompanied me. I will admit that if you get fries and a hot dog, it's rather pricey for lunch. He asked if they had combo meals...hehehe. I ordered the Banh Mi hot dog and the angry kimchi fries with a soda. My total came to $12 and change. He ordered the buckeye dog and the Euro Special fries. The place was packed so there was a little wait time for our food. The portions for the fries were huge. I could have ordered the fries alone and still not been able to finish. The banh mi hot dog was flavorful, but not enough to make it worth the $5 I paid for it. I've had hot dogs of equal taste at Sonic or Weinerschnitzel. My friend concurred on his hot dog as well. The fries however stole the show! The Angry Kimchi fries were packed with huge flavors, and just when I thought I had tasted it all, a new texture or spiciness punched me in the mouth. I thought the jalapenos were fresh and zesty. The kimchi was heated yet still maintained the crunchy veggie texture that I love. The sweet potato fries were salty, sweet and crunchy. The melted cheese sort of calmed the dish down, yet infused a nice melted gooeyness into it. The bulgogi was tender and mildly spicy. All together I loved the fries and will most definitely order them again. My friend's Euro Fries were also scrumptious. The pork belly combined with the garlic mayo was a perfect blend of fry toppings. I'll be back for the fries no doubt. Oh, and the service was top notch!"}

Then its topped with teriyaki beef, roasted peppers, and I added caramelized onions. This is coming from some one who only eats chili dogs or plain hot dogs, so trust me when I say give this place a chance. The prices are very decent and the food comes out quick and hot.

The bun of my  bulgogi dog fell apart because there was so much meat on it, so I ended up eating it with a fork and a knife.  I jokingly said told the waitress about it when she asked me how my food was.  I didn't mind the bun falling apart really, but she insisted that she would bring me another one, but there was no way I was going to eat it because I was full.

I tried a few of their hot dogs- Bulgogi hot dog, West Coast dog, angry dog, etc. Their angry kimchi fries are wonderful as well. There's a hangover chicken soup and bulgogi bibimbap that was OK at the time but I wouldn't order it again. I think I'll just stick with their hot dogs and fries.

I am not the biggest fan of hot dogs in general but a fusion hot dog, that is another story.  So I stopped in this last weekend.  I was mostly impressed.  I ordered a bulgogi dog after standing in line for a few minutes.  Usually I avoid standing in lines unless I am familiar with the place and love it so much.  But I had driven all that way and everything on the menu sounded good.  Besides, standing in line afforded me the time to decide which of the many hot dog creations I wanted to try.  As I mentioned before, I settled on the bulgogi dog.  I was not really sure what to expect.  What I got would have exceded any expectations I may have had had I gone in with any expectations.  What I got was friendly service, surprisingly good food and freshness.  I was impressed.  The all beef dog seemed more like a sausage.  It was plump and full of flavor.  Flavor of the good kind.  It taste like meat.  Not parts.  The beef on top was very tender and slightly sweet the way I know bulgogi to be.  For $4.95, not a bad deal.  Very fair.  Cheaper than Pinks.  I think I will be back someday.  Perhaps I should try a different dog.  They all look so good."}

The top quality of the hot dogs the gourmet toppings the homemade ketchup and mayo the list goes on and on this why I believe this to be among one of the superior hot dog restaurants in Las Vegas. I had the Southern Dog and Mr Ed had the Chicago Dog and speaking for myself the Southern was a symphony for the taste buds I mean if you truly love hot dogs as I do then Buldogis he has to be on your list of favorites after the first tasting.  To Chef Cesar  you truly have made Hot Dogs Gourmet. This was my first visit but most definitely not my last visit I will definitely become a regular fixture at Buldogis. To sum it all up Mmmmmmmm Gooooood!!!!!!!! Keep up the Great Work."}

The fries were darn good and the dogs were great too. We both really liked the carne asada dog , dragon dog and the angry dog. But toward the end it all started tasting the same perhaps it was just too much. But another reason might be even thought the topics on the dogs were different, the dogs were mostly the same so that might be why they kinda did taste the same.  Don't get me wrong all the dogs were pretty good, just don't try too many at ones lol."}

You absolutely can feel that they take food seriously and I wish them the very best. We tried a chili dog, a Chicago dog, and the carne asada fries. The chili had a strange mealy texture resulting in an unpleasant mouth feel, it did not taste like it simmered on the stove to allow the flavors to develop,  and it left me yearning for a $1.50 hot dog from Sam's club (which includes a drink). The actual hot dog itself is okay, but the chili was very difficult to eat. The Chicago dog was fair and made with lots of fresh veggies. The carne asada fries were made with meat that was reminiscent of Teriyaki  beef, so it gave the dish a mix of sweet, sour, and spicy flavors that were not seamlessly integrated."}

On the menu it's called Carne Asada~ A Beef Bulgogi loaded with Five Cheese Blend, Pico De Gallo, Diced Jalapeno, Chipotle Mayo, Avacado Mayo.

I'm usually a chili dog or ketchup and onions gal, so having the banh mi dog with pork belly, slaw and sriracha mayo was a bit of a leap for me, but it was soooo good. The hotdogs themselves are delicious, and the unusual concoctions just work. I tried a bit of the buckeye dog too and it was just as good.

I won't say it had an authentic style Chicago hot dog, but it was really freakin' awesome all the same.  Plus, my wife and I tried some deep fried pickle spears, and they were really good, as well as their dipping sauces; one was a really flavorful ranch, another was a barbeque with hints of Korean seasoning, and then a spicy mayo/mustard mix.  The hot dogs are really large and they don't skimp on any of the fixings they put on top as well.  Really good place for really good hot dogs!"}

I really like the slaw they put on top of the hot dog.  For those that aren't into hotdogs, Buldogis also offers fusion burgers and fries.

I got the off the menu hot dog that was named me - the Gang Nam Dog (hot dog, roasted pork belly, sliced cucumber, nori flakes, green onions, sesame seeds, Korean chili sauce). It tasted fantastic! Also tried a friend's Hawaiian Dog (hot dog, pork belly, pineapple salsa, g-onions, honey Dijon mustard), which had a nice welcomed slight sweetness from the pineapple and honey mustard. The Euro Special fries (pork belly bacon, cheddar cheese, herb blend, garlic mayo, fries) and the Carne Asada fries (beef bulgogi, 5 cheese blend. pico de gallo, diced jalapeno, chipotle mayo, avocado mayo, fries) were bomb with the carne asada one being more flavorful. One of my friend is a regular here so they hooked us all up with free drinks. Checking in on Yelp gets you a 10% discount. Staff are really friendly and helpful.

It's a typical, small hot dog shop/diner, serving up some really yummy creations. You can get anything from bulgogi to their take on a Chicago dog for toppings, even as a vegetarian hot dog, if you prefer. My favorite here is the west coast dog, topped with grilled onions, cheese, and seriously, the most delicious avocado mayo. I prefer a real Chicago dog to their version, but maybe they felt the need to switch it up because they are next door to Chicago Brewing Co."}

The combo of the dog, kimchi, pickled peppers, catchup & mustard make it much too salty, however.  I think the bulgogi or spicy pork with the addition of kimchi will be the real winners.  Still, this is good stuff."}

With that said, our taste buds are spoiled with amazing food fushions and we find ourselves to be extremely picky and snobby when it comes to food. We are huge foodies and generally take a mom and pop establishment over a corporate food chain restaurants any day out of the week. What we really loved about Buldogies was it's risky twist in turning a basic dog into a Korean infused work of art! Kimchee and bulgogie with your dog?! I know, sounds crazy, but trust me, it's amazing! Caesar, the owner was an extremely nice gentleman when I asked if he could throw something together that my mom (Korean) would make us growing up.  He didn't hesitate and he made it exactly how my mom made it! We also had the wings......killer! Super crispy and full of flavor, you really don't need dipping sauce! If you're bored of the same ol chain restaurant experience, please take my advice and give Buldogies a try, it won't disappoint!!!!"}

I also have to tip my hat to the owner, somehow I always end up chatting with this guy when I come in. This guy is a super super nice, all around salt of the earth kind of guy. Hes super honest, he works more hours than anyone would care to admit, works his a** off to keep this place running and do all the prep work for his new food truck  from his restaurant while operating active food service . Definitely a restaurant I want to support just in that, this is a case of the little guy (non corporate) private owner busting his hump to make it work.

We've been longing for a high quality sushi restaurant, ever since experiencing Sushi Sasabune, twice I might add, in Honolulu. After trying one local restaurant after the other, all rated 4 to 5 stars on Yelp, we were greeted with disappointment again and again, until now.

{"business_id": "AYbUb5UcAngroJ6uJG7tLQ", "text": "First time we came here it was phenomenal. Second time, not so much. Of note, our favorite item both times being the negitoro hand roll. This time we ordered one omakase ($80) and one nigiri tasting ($48). The main differences between the omakase and nigiri tasting are 6 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of grilled fish, and miso soup. Was it worth the extra $32? Certainly not. The main problem during this visit was that the serving sizes were significantly smaller than last time, ranging from 1/3 to 1/2 smaller. The first time we had 2 nigiri tastings because that was all they were offering at the time. While we weren't stuffed, our hunger was comfortably satiated. This time around we paid for more food, but both left hungry. In fact, as we left, I seriously considered stopping by Ramen Sora! The quality overall is still excellent, except for the surprisingly subpar miso soup, but they have gotten stingy with their portion sizes. Previously, while not an inexpensive night out, the price could be considered reasonable. Sadly this is no longer the case. We are not big eaters and when we pay $128, before tax/tip, for two tasting menus, we expect to at least not be still hungry at the end. We don't mind shelling out top dollar for great food, but it is difficult to justify paying these prices for what have become miniscule portions of food. In addition, the service this time was inconsistent at best. The timing between courses was highly variable as was when our glasses of water were refilled. It is heartbreaking, and we are unlikely to return."}

Don't get me wrong the fish quality was very high but not much better than other higher end sushi restaurants that were cheaper.  Your paying for ambiance and intimacy but I found it hard to justify the prices for sushi. There was nothing all that special or unique about their fish when you compare it to other higher end restaurants. The most unique thing I noticed was how small all their portions of fish were.  I am not advocating disgustingly large portions as is typical with many American restaurants but this was a bit ridiculous to me. We spent around 200 per person ordering both omakase and a la carte. I would recommend eating something before going if you don't want to spend too much money trying to fill yourself on sushi."}

When the Michelin Guide returns to Las Vegas, this restaurant is worthy of multiple Michelin stars. You may search many places in many cities, but it is unlikely that you will find truly pure sushi like what you will find at Kabuto. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that is served here melts in your mouth. The fish is to die for and I have often found that I am ruined after my meals that I have had here. There just isn't any other sushi restaurant that lives up to Gen-san's, short of spending thousands of dollars to fly to Ginza to eat at Sukiyabashi Jiro. Don't walk, run, and make reservations as soon as possible."}

In any case, as you enter the restaurant, it's cleanest/most sterile sushi bar I think I have every seen.  The appearance is very simplistic with light wood sushi bar.  Sushi chefs are standing  right across from you waiting to prepare sushi iron chef style right in front of you.  No soy sauce or wasabi dish needed here.  The chefs prepare each piece with care as they brush the sauce before they place it before you to eat.  The menu is different every day and the fish they have are not like anything you've ever heard of.  In speaking with one of the chefs, he said in the 15 months they've been open, he's prepared over 400 different types of fish.  I didn't even know there are that many types of fish available for sushi!  The meal starts with an iced sake shot to clean your palate, the chefs then start the sushi presentation, the toro and chu-toro were incredible.

Pre-order ahead of time to get a seat at the bar table and you'll choose one of the three Omakase course. I recommend drinking water to cleanse your taste buds, but you can have a choice to order a bottle of saki for 30 bucks. We took the first choice which was the 48 dollar Nigiri choice of a ten piece sushi meal. You can order more individual pieces which range from 4-7 bucks during the course of the meal. They'll give you a sweet icy saki shot at first and a quick appetizer. As soon as your mouth starts watering they'll serve the main course of sushi one by one, each one progressively getting better and better. Then they'll give you the dessert, a Japanese style blend of sweetness of your choosing. The presentation was very interesting due to the amount of discipline they have while preparing the sushi.

We got a bunch of tuna such as medium fatty toro, ikura and toro hand roll.  At first I felt the meal was going by too quickly but it ended up being an hour and half.  Along with the sushi, you get sake and you get ice cream.  Sake was very good as was the ice cream.  I've never had roasted green tea ice cream.  It was such a great flavor.

Having recently visited Tokyo, I can appreciate the preparation and pride this restaurant takes in their food. The sushi and sashimi here can stand up to many of the fine establishments in Tokyo and the price at Kabuto is very reasonable for the quality you receive. They are passionate about the way their food is presented and inspect each piece of fish carefully before serving. Any sushi pro knows that not only is the fish an important aspect of sushi but the rice is equally if not more important. The rice was prepared very well (warm with a slight hint of vinegar). The taste of the rice complemented the fish so well it makes my mouth water thinking of it now. The service was friendly and the servers were helpful in educating the patrons on where each food item came from. In case you didn't already know, they receive their products fresh daily from all over the world. One place that they receive their fish from is the famous Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. The fish here meets the standards of fish sold right at that market. The chefs prepare each plate as a piece of art and the timing of each food item is perfect. If you are a foodie and like traditional Japanese sushi then you must check this place out. No cream cheese and spicy mayo rolls here! In my opinion there is no other sushi restaurant in Vegas that is close to Kabuto. That includes the big names on the strip."}

I recommend starting with the middle omokase (yoroi) and adding extra bites afterwards. It is hard to get reservations and find, but your mind will be blind. Definitely order the tuna triangle and meijina with lemon and sea salt. The chefs are true artists."}

The place isn't that big, but it can accommodate big parties and what not. From the outside to the inside, place looks boring, it honestly looks like the old ass restaurants you see on Restaurant: Impossible, where Robert Irvine has to pretty much go in there and tear it apart. So yes the restaurant looks boring, and yes it is the definition of a hole in the wall, so I'd assume the food was going to be great..but the pho was just pretty decent; I ordered the pho tai bo vien which comes with rare steak and beef balls. I like that the beef balls weren't tiny and that this place actually give quite a few, and the rare steak was actually rare steak. The broth was so so, wasn't superb, and wasn't shit, just ok. Orders come out slow, but they tell you that on a sign saying something about freshness and made to order.....then again, pho broth does take more than 20 mins to make and everything else; noodles, meat, veggies are all add ins so freshness is very vague lol."}

I was attracted to this place due to the fact that they have nem nuong on the menu, but came to soothe my hang over with some soup. We ordered the bun bo hue, bun rieu, nem nuong, and egg rolls. First off let me say, this vietnamese joint has the best I mean the best service any vietnamese restaurant has to offer. Our waitress was nice, attentive, and didn't have his thumb in my soup when he dropped it off. We actually got our waters filled without having to wave someone down. The fact that he treated us with such great service and knowing that we are not regulars made me become more of a fan. The nem nuong was rolled freshly when we ordered and came out quickly. It was very good. The dipping sauce was on point. The egg rolls came with noodles, lettuce and vietnamese herbs to roll and dip. They gave us individual sauce bowls so there will be no double dipping. I got the bun bo hue and my soup came out super hot which I loved. The broth was amazing, just the right amount spice, good meat to noodles ratio. I usually have to add so much to my broth to make it the way I want it. But not with this place, all I had to do was add my herbs and veggies and eat. I tasted my hubs bun rieu and that too was amazing. I'm really glad I found out about this place, this will be our new to go to place when we're in Vegas. Btw everything is made fresh to order so there might be a wait for your food. But who cares about 15 mins when you get amazing food and service."}

Their signature dish is bun bo hue, which is one of my absolute favorite dishes.  I'm originally from northern Virginia, where they know how to do it right.  So, this place has a lot of learning to do when it comes to vietnamese spices.  The bun bo hue lacked so much flavor- it tasted like salted brown water with red coloring floating on top.  The blood cake tasted not right.  I asked the server why it was sooo bland and he said there's separate seasoning they add when they serve it, like in the vietnamese region of hue. Well heck, I ordered bun bo hue, not watered down whatever it is you served me.  My husband had a rice dish with egg rolls, shrimp cake and nem. He said the shrimp cake was good but the nem (pork sausage) had zero flavor.  We live in Hawaii and were hoping for some great VN food in LV but this place was disappointing.

But for such a small restaurant, they had quite a few people working there.  I believe there were a total of 8 people including the owner.  Luckily this place wasn't very busy when I arrived for lunch, so I was able to sit at a table.  The service was very good, which is typical of Japanese restaurants.  I ordered their pork cutlet curry on rice and a side order of chicken katsu. Their curry sauce is quite good, but I would have preferred a little bit more curry sauce.  I also tried their curry pan and it was delicious.  This deep fried panko bun with curry inside would have been perfect had it been a little bit warmer.  It was very tasty and the texture of the bun was excellent.   For a quick Japanese curry fix, give this place a try."}

You order either a regular or half-size of white or brown rice with curry. Then you add accompaniments like tonkatsu, chicken katsu, potato croquette, and kurobuta sausage. I usually love a nice tonkatsu, but theirs is a bit dry and tough so I suggest going with the chicken katsu instead. Skip the miniscule salad . It's not worth the $1.50 price."}

My boyfriend wanted to try it so off we went.  There was a big party taking up the only tables in the place and we ended up at the counter.  A little claustrophobic maybe at the counter.  The menu is small.  There basically is one curry that can have a few options of meat and everything comes with rice.  But the curry is good and flavorful and makes me happy.  It has something like 13 different spices in it which all contribute to your health somehow.  None the less we gobbled up everything on our plates, didn't pay very much and we left with a warm belly of curry."}

My only gripe is that the vegetables I think were $2 extra and were not a substantial portion for the price, but I wanted to feel somewhat healthy that day and would probably continue to order it here - prices are pretty low to begin with already, so I guess it wasn't that bad.

My boyfriend and I have tried lots of curry places in Vegas and LA area (he lives there), but this place has the most flavor and is the best curry we have yet to come across.  Just wished they had a non deep fried meat option, example grilled chicken.  Cause I always crave curry but can't eat deep fried stuff that often, health reasons. :)"}

First the curry is delicious, and you can order traditional curry alone, or throw in some chicken, fried tofu, or even quail egg skewers on the dish. You can choose white, brown, or a multi-grain rice options along with the curry. They even have curry pan, which I look forward to giving a try next time I stop in. The restaurant was just recently remodeled, which has given it some more moving space, as the seating was a bit tight before. The folks who run it are very nice, and the service is good.

It creeps up on you though and lingers after, so beware! I like the spinach curry with chicken cutlet and sausage. There's some jars of pickled veggies on the table and they add a nice texture to the dishes. I like the ginger the best. Try this place out ...

You can choose either white or brown rice to accompany the dish, our fav is the brown. This is not your ordinary Indian or Chinese curry. It's a secret Japanese style that is usually cooked hours on end. I don't know how this recipe is prepared or how long it's cooked but it tasted really good. You can get it in a range of how spicy you like the dish from 1-10. The server didn't ask us and I totally forgot so I was a tad bit disappointed that the dish was not as spicy as I would like.

Our waitress was very courteous and attentive throughout our meal, but you could tell she was new to her job.  The food arrived slowly.  We only were able to finish our chicken satay due to a flight to catch.  The satay was descent.  I thought the chicken looked more baked than grilled.  Pad mee prik kang we took to go.  It was a little more on the oily side but it was very tasty.  Although we were not impressed with our first visit we definitely would  return to try other dishes."}

Having visited six times since it opened, I have found the food and service to always be great.  Each item has always been cooked to the perfect temperature and the prices are incredible for the quality.  The service is excellent, I am unsure why every restaurant does not take the time to train the staff like Chada obviously has.  Add in riedel stemware, a convenient location, nice buildout and a great playlist.....go."}

The food was decent and service was fine overall. We brought our own bottle of wine, there is no corkage fee, which we liked. The portions are rather small, but the prices are not high either. We had lettuce wraps with crab meat for appetizer, pork belly and yellow curry as a main dish. I did not care for dessert - coconut jelly. I will go back again."}

They also keep their recipes fairly simple.  I've enjoyed most dishes from Chada, clean, clear, good combination of flavors.  Not much to complain for the price, minus chicken wings appetizer being overcooked and with too much sauce for my taste once, everything else is well executed .  I love the simplicity of their desserts, like the sticky rice with mango but I wish they also offered something more elaborated.  Chada has become one of my to go places in the area, in the same mall as another favorite China Mama.  I would definitively recommend to give it a try."}

The first time I came here it was with a large group so we tried nearly everything on the menu. Everything was spectacular. I came here again with some friends. I got the eggplant and shrimp with chile-lime dressing. I thought it would be more like a stir-fry dish but they were neat little bites an not a heavy sauce. It was really yummy but a little more on the appetizer side than entree. My friend had the green curry and it was a perfect balance of flavor and spice and not overpowering coconut milk like usual. We also had the mushrooms and brussle sprout appetizers. In a random strip mall but inside is swanky and dim lighting. Everything was so delicious I can't wait to go back again."}

The 5 options by the glass are just OK.   We had fried oysters, drunken noodles, curry and sticky rice. Fried oysters were beautifully presented and curry was quite delicious.

The guy next to me got three dishes and a bottle of wine before me and he was sitting in his booth for ten minutes. I don't think fried spring rolls takes 25 minutes especially when they are pre made and the restaurant only had three other tables.

When asking to speak to Manager, they just left us standing for 15 minutes and no one ever came out. There is a lack of gratitude for their customers business' that is remarkable.

I think that was a good decision though because I could dip my prawns in the most delicious curry I've ever had in my life!!! Just thinking about it now makes me want more!!

You have to call to make reservation and you can't call before five because they won't answer the phone.  However it's a great place to share a meal with your friends as we found out. It has a very extensive wine list so we started with a bottle of white wine. I would generally drink red but the friend I was dining with always drinks white so I'm game. We each picked an appetizer and we shared those.  After that we decided to each pick an entr\u00e9e and share that also. The food is so good you could just keep eating and eating. They didn't seem to mind that we ordered our dinner in stages and they didn't seem to mind that we lingered over our wine even though as the night wore on it got busier and louder. I can't agree that it's better than the Thai place near the green  door (still an absolute favorite of mine) but it is really excellent Thai food and I agree that if you don't like Thai food you should go anyway--it's that good!!!"}

Two Cornish hen entrees were listed in the online menu, though neither appeared in the printed version.  Instead, we shared  orders of pad see eiw with chicken - flat rice noodles stir fried with egg, Chinese broccoli and black soy sauce plus pad kee mao (aka drunken noodles) with chicken - flat rice noodles, hot chili, garlic and basil.

It smelled really  foul and was blatantly bad.  It's forgivable but it was very unpleasant.  The duck curry was very good however, it was very small .  It was portioned as an appetizer and was lacking for a $20+ entree.   Still one of the greatest in town but it cost them a star in my book."}

The guy told me that they were busy so to come the next morning and they would refund me. So I went and the owner Annie went completely crazy shushing me out saying that the guy who answered the phone didn't know what he was talking about and saying she didn't care what he said that she's in charge and she can't help us.

So I defaulted to 3. I grew up eating viet food in northern cali, so id like to think I know what good viet food is. Its starting to get pretty hot outside so Pho is out of the question,  so I decided to get some refreshing viet items. I had the shrimp and pork spring rolls and vermicelli w grilled pork and egg roll. Everything tasted good enough but felt as though could have been better. For instance the spring roll had great fillings big shrimp and freshly cooked noodles and lettuce but really lacked on the pork side. The vermicelli dish had alot of meat but had way too much vegetables for the amount of noodles I received. id say I received 50% meat, 35% veggies, and 15% noodles. The flavor of the meat was great, very tender not much fat *which is nice bec most of the time thit nuong is fatty* , most of this i could get past buuuuut the nuoc mam (fish sauce) that came with it was pretty bad. It was really sour, too sour, seemed like they needed to add more fish sauce and sugar to take the lemon bite down. Kinda killed the whole dish for me, as that is a staple thing in Bun. Hence why I leaned towards a 3 versus a 4. I think that it would be a great alternative to Chinatown for the southwest folks like myself, if they had a couple little tweaks. That being said having been to ALL the other Pho places in the southwest, Annie's the clear winner. Ill definitely be back to try their pho, but probably wont get any dish that requires nuoc mam."}

For dinner, I ordered a grilled pork rice plate, which is supposed to come with a side of broth, but they forgot the broth too! At least the pork was  tender and flavorful. I also ordered chicken curry noodle soup for another entree. It was good, except too thick and more curry than soup like. I also ordered hot tea, which was oddly served in plastic cups instead of a a traditional tea kettle and tea cups.

Either we made the bad choice of coming here near closing or it was a bad day, I don't know, but the food wasn't all too great. The spring rolls were predominantly carb. See the pictures. The beef noodles definitely aren't the best I've had, but it's a classic Hong Kong dish that I wouldn't expect to be done perfectly at a Vietnamese restaurant, so that's okay. Regardless, I'm still coming back because it's convenient and decently priced. I'll be planning to try more dishes. It's also probably bad that I still haven't tried the pho here yet, considering it's in the name. Next time!"}

Service is a hit or miss, since they always seem to be short-staffed. Just last night I saw a potentially large party leave since they weren't acknowledged for a long time. I also had to flag down a server multiple times to get the soup that was supposed to come with our order, and re-ask for our drinks (even after that, we were still one short). One of the empty plates we had weren't thoroughly cleaned and had remnants of a spring roll wrapper on it, we didn't even bother letting them know about the issue. In any case, the food is pretty consistent. I prefer the pork rice plate which comes with an over easy egg and a side of plain broth. My husband likes the shaken beef, which is a higher quality beef. Parking is easy here and  they do take-out so shaky service aside, people will still keep this place busy."}

Throwing caution to the wind, we even had fries on the side instead of salad---I mean, really, if you're going to clog your arteries, you must commit all the way.

The rolls were cold, although the meat was warm. The pot stickers came out greasy; had been cooked at too low a temperature. My companion's reuben had thick, salty corned beef, although it was grilled, a plus. Chef Sheridan was not on duty today. Check before ordering.

When I was there I noticed that there were no tofu bao for the veggie eaters like me :( BUT, my buddy that went with me the first time went down for a second time and Jenny was nice enough to let her know that they finally made some room on the menu for it!!  Yes!!  So, once I get out of the tangles of grad school and ready to indulge on another culinary adventure at Fat Choy, better believe I'm gonna hit up that bao and cool noodle!"}

We also tried the medium hot chicken wings, wonton soup, and the shortrib grilled cheese sandwich.  The restaurant itself is attractive, we were seated immediately and I had already perused the menu online so had a good idea of what I wanted to try.  The BF tried the wonton soup, came with crispies and he said it was very good.  I tasted the broth and thought it very tasty.  We both enjoyed the chicken wings, ordered crispy.  They came cooked just right and they were not greasy,  but were not reallly spicy at all to my taste.  They were still very tasty, I just expected morebite I guess. Next time I will try the HOT ones.  BF wished they had had the hot mustard that some chinese places have but they did not have it here, onlly the srihacha hot sauce.  The potstickers were divine.  I loved the sauce they came with and devoured all of them.  The sandwich was good, but needed more salt.  All in all we left stuffed, happy and wanting to come back.  I want to try more items here, the angus burger and the duck rice.  We felt the meal was tasty and satisfactory.  We will be back!!  The only drawback today was that the service was a bit slow, there was only one waitress and the restaurant was not  very busy.  She was very pleasant but we had to wait for our dishes and the check."}

Rather then bore you with painstaking descriptions of each item in an attempt to sound like a connoisseur I'll make this brief; this food is crazy good, the service is charming and the location is ....the Eureka Casino.  I've read some complaints about the prices but I really don't understand it.  Given the quality of the food and a menu where entrees are all around $10 I'd rate Fat Choy as an incredible bargain.   I guess some of the old regulars might miss the $3 breakfast specials but  that was a different restaurant and this is a completely different level of cooking.  As for the Eureka casino the place is a dive but that's half the fun.  When you march your out of town guests through the casino to get to Fat Choy most will try to bail and head to the nearest Applebees.  But after dinner they'll be calling their friends to tell them about their adventure and how they discovered one of the best insider secrets in town.  Seriously the casino is smoky but they seem to be managing things pretty well in the restaurant.  Just ask for a table away from the door or a seat at the counter and enjoy."}

The wife ordered a Fat Choy Burger. It was a little too much on the greasy side. Maybe some people like it like that, but she didn't. Again, props to Jenny, our server.

The duck was flavorless, dry, and seemed over cooked. Even the salad was very bland with hardly any dressing, and no Asian flare to it- and I am normally one to complain that there is too MUCH dressing. My husband had the Fat Choy burger which tasted okay as far as $10 burgers go, definitely had no Asian flare to it. His fries were over salted. Overall, I was very disappointed.

You get 2 with each order for  $7 an order, I thought it was a bit much for such small bites. Flavors were good on both and I would say the pork belly was a little better. The duck was crispy but all the flavor was in the sauce not from the duck meat.

Service was a little slow but so worth it. The pork belly bao is one of the finest morsels of delectability I've ever tasted. Soft, sweet, smoky and tangy...it alone is worth a visit. Pot stickers were money, shortrib grill cheese an absolute smash hit also, 2+ kinds of cheese with super tender braised short ribs shredded on top of the cheeses. Damn, I want another one now. Our server Val was super friendly and attentive. Easy access to cheap cheap booze at the bar about 10 steps outside the restaraunt. $3.50 for a jack and coke.

I had their bbblt next. It's great tasting with flavorful marinade.  It's bit heavy so be prepared.  They also have healthy choice noodles. This will be my next choice.  Good eating."}

This place is in a sketchy, rundown casino (no card games... just slots)  Park in the back. It's in old town Vegas so you can visit the Pawn Stars ship afterwards. The tiny casino doesn't serve any hard liquor.... only beer. It's a place for foodies... And a group of cargo-short wearing guys."}

The pork belly and duck baos are delicious and made perfectly.  I wish the dumplings were a bit meatier, kind of skimpy for the price.  Today I ordered the duck fried rice to have for dinner later."}
{"business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ", "text": "The location is a bit rough. But its worth the trip. The service is friendly and efficient. The menu is Asian comfort food. We had the Pork bell bao to start- excellent. For our mains we shared a fat choy burger, duck confit plate and short rib plate. They were all  yum but the duck and burger get major kudos. Go for dessert too!  Definitely will be back despite the neighborhood ;)"}

We shared everything and we loved it all! It was the perfect amount of food for us and we left being happy as can be! Tammi Jo was awesome and so sweet. We will definitely come back here and try all the items! It is located in the Eureka casino and it's actually a pretty ok place. The restaurant was decorated very nicely, and I love the red glitter booths, it was super clean and I highly recommend coming here!"}

{"business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ", "text": "If you like duck that has crispy skin, meat that falls apart, and flavors that meld together in your mouth, then you would most likely like this place. Everyone's already listed the highlights of this place, so I won't regurgitate the same review. But, I think what Sheridan does with common items, like buffalo wings, is what makes his food superb. His buffalo wings were probably the best cooked wings i've ever had...crispy on the outside and damn juicy on the inside. You need to come try for yourself."}

PLEASE come and you will be happy....."}
{"business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ", "text": "I'm sad to give this place 2 stars bc my husband & I had a great experience the last couple of times when we were here.  We especially loved their baos but  when we ate here recently their baos were different. I had ordered their mushroom & tofu bao & it wasn't the same. If I remember correctly the tofu & mushrooms were cut up but this time they put a slab of tofu which I prefer it cut up & mixed in with the mushrooms. The duck bao didn't taste as flavorful. It took our food about 30-40 mins to come out & the restaurant wasn't even busy. I want the old Great Bao to come back!"}

{"business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ", "text": "At our lunch of 6 people, almost every dish was polished off.  The duck rice has a piece of duck that seriously falls off of the bone.  Mixing the duck meat with the egg and rice created a creamy, just-enough fatty dish that was hard to resist.  The duck bao was incredibly, finished with hoisen sauce and a sliver of cucumber.  And the grilled cheese with short rib meat was over the moon delicious!  We'll be back!"}
{"business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ", "text": "Ok so it's in a pretty random location but the best finds usually are. Perfect place to park your butt after a late night on the town for some Peking Duck Bao which is amazing. I also had Sesame Noodles which were fantastic as well. Has a small deli kinda feel but the service is top notch. I will not leave town without making another visit to this place. Yummy !"}

The Brazilian stew(moqueca) is out of this world amazing, the Felicdad on Sundays is SOOO so good, the Las Vegas, NVsteak sandwich, and pao the queijo appetizer...whoa! I could go on forever. A caipirinha with my meal always hits the spot. It's like a taste of Las Vegas, NVright here in the city. Very authentic. Really, give it a try. You're in for a real treat!!!"}
{"business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ", "text": "I had seen Sheridan on a tv cooking competition and wanted to try out his food. We had the pork bao, duck bao, and potstickers. My favorite was the pork bao. Atmosphere was a modest and comfortable diner, which can be a nice change in over the top Las Vegas. They had roasted marrow on the specials but we are saving that for another visit. This place is worth a short trip from the strip."}
{"business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ", "text": "Fat Choy is highly recommended by me.  Went here last friday and I almost missed the restaurant. I didn't realize at first that it's located in the Eureka casino.  Small dining area. Ordered the fat Choy burger and pork belly bao. Both totally worth the price at $7 for the bao and I got the same amount as I did at Ramsey's burger for nearly half the price.  Next time I will try the duck bao. Really can't recommend this enough at the price."}
{"business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ", "text": "If you are in Vegas anytime, you will have to check this place out. A little off the strip. Located inside a casino. The location at night time looks a little sketchy, but trust me, well worth it. Delicious little gem in Vegas. The burger is one of the best burgers I have had, and I have had a lot of burgers. Just very flavorful. And the staff is awesome, very accommodating! I remember we tried helping the waitress move the tables to fit out party and she insisted she do it. Unless we wanted to take her job she stated. LoL. Awesome!"}
