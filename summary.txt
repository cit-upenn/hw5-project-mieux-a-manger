Project Description:
Mieux a Manger is a React web page that prompts user authentic restaurant suggestions by weighting yelp reviews differently. We first dove into the large Yelp dataset to parse the JSON files and link up Users, Reviews and Businesses. Then we adopted a proprietary algorithm that ranks the expertise of a particular reviewer in the given cuisine category. By assigning different weights to reviews based on reviewer rankings, we found the top 5 restaurants in each cuisine category. We further found the key words among users reviews for the top 5 restaurants and generated word clouds.

Technical Explanations:
The technical build of the project consists of three parts: analysis of the large dataset, NLP, and React web page. 

Because the dataset is very large, we have to store our final results into JSON instead of doing real time processing of raw data. The web page will in turn load the saved final results to present.

This approach means that we no longer need to use a web app framework like Django. Instead, we only need to set up the "V" in the MVC pattern. So we decided to use Facebook's React JS framework, along with bootstrap styling. 

In order to build the final JSON for the webpage to load, we broke down the large yelp data into smaller JSON files and only considered Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Thai.

We assigned user weighting by ranking user by the number of total reviews and reviews in each cuisine category. While the last user (ranked ~30,000th) will get 1 point, the 1st ranked user will get 30,000 points. We then multiply the points to their review score for each restaurant. 

The ranking process, however, takes a very long time to process. For demonstration purposes, we only ran the algorithm once based on total reviews and artificially generated rankings for reviews in each cuisine. We then calculated the corresponding score for each business. This compromise is made because we are not focusing on ranking algorithms for this class. 

Last but not least, we used tf-idf to get key words from reviews. More specifically we used sklearn to drastically improve processing time, but we still built our own algorithms as well. We also built our own stop list. 

Note that we mostly used module instead of classes in our Python code, because we simply don't have enough shared state to justify constructing classes. 

Work Breakdown:
Yibang - data wrangling; Qi - building front end and NLP scripts; Collaboration - ranking algorithm.
